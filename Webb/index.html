      Incan women were typically married at the age of sixteen because of poverty , while men married at the age of twenty. Age, however, was not as important as keeping track of the stage of life that a person was at, such as whether or not they were able to work or be married. Ranks played a role in a person's marriage status as well. Men of lower rank could have only one wife; people of ranks higher than the kuraka were allowed more If a man had more than one wife, one served as the principal wife while the other(s) were considered secondary.

      What about in our modern era?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text-parag"> 
      More than 650 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday. Twenty-one per cent of young women (20-24 years old) around the world were child brides. And while early marriage is most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, it also takes place in high-income countries. some are forced to marry in an early age with an adult because of religious reasons and traditions. There is good news: global child marriage rates are slowly falling. Around 2000, one in three women between the ages of 20 and 24 reported they had been married as children. In 2017, this number was just over one in five. Rates of child marriage before age 15 also fell, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 5 per cent in 2017.

    <h1>SOLUTION</h1>
    <h2>Our Solution is to create a website that will contain the following:</h2>
  </div>

<div class="seccontainer">
  <div class="solution-text">
    <p>Separate those in poverty that had education and those who didn’t have an education. This includes the people’s information like name, age, status(if have), and more ( job experiences).
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="seccontainer">
  <div class="solution-text">
    <p>Set up a donation page/tab for those who don’t have education so they can finish or at least get some education. As some jobs have high educational qualifications and can help us get a better-paid job.
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="seccontainer">
  <div class="solution-text">
    <p>Set up a tab/page that contains a list of job offerings with minimal qualifications for those that finished until kindergarten or elementary school
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="seccontainer">
  <div class="solution-text">
    <p>Set up a social media page that can reach out to people that have experience who would be willing to help the people in poverty directly by helping out with creating a website or finding job offerings through companies that need people willing to take jobs, and more.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="seccontainer">
  <div class="solution-text">
    <p>Find homeless shelters / Temporary housing that the government creates to help and give directions to the people without shelter to give those in poverty that can’t afford shelter, a temporary house.
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="seccontainer">
  <div class="solution-text">
    <p>Find people who are willing to help the people in poverty’s professions as it is beneficial to both parties involved (example: someone has a talent for business making but they are in poverty, we will find someone willing to help them set up a business)
</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="seccontainer">
  <div class="solution-text">
    <p>How to contact - We're going to be making a poster about our website and it will include our Website name, link, our number and email ( Not personal, working. ), as well as a place they could go to, to meet up with someone to talk to about the website.
</p>

<div class="seccontainer">

    <p>place: we could make some donations and rent a place with the help of the people we found on social media that are willing to help us continue this campaign.
