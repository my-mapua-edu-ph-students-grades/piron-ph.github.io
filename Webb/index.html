    <h2 class="text-parag" data-aos="fade-right"> 
      Incan women were typically married at the age of sixteen because of poverty , while men married at the age of twenty. Age, however, was not as important as keeping track of the stage of life that a person was at, such as whether or not they were able to work or be married. Ranks played a role in a person's marriage status as well. Men of lower rank could have only one wife; people of ranks higher than the kuraka were allowed more If a man had more than one wife, one served as the principal wife while the other(s) were considered secondary.

      More than 650 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday. Twenty-one per cent of young women (20-24 years old) around the world were child brides. And while early marriage is most prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, it also takes place in high-income countries. some are forced to marry in an early age with an adult because of religious reasons and traditions. There is good news: global child marriage rates are slowly falling. Around 2000, one in three women between the ages of 20 and 24 reported they had been married as children. In 2017, this number was just over one in five. Rates of child marriage before age 15 also fell, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 5 per cent in 2017.

    <h1 class="title-parag">WHY OUR SOLUTION IS UNIQUE?</h1>
    <p class="text-parag">our solution is possible to fulfill at our age and our campaign has media platforms that especially work as we are currently in a pandemic and the usage of social media has increased. A website that we can create that will help other people directly and this solution gives awareness to other people and they could help the others directly via donations or joining the campaign and this solution is accessible even if we include the fact about the occurring pandemic in our human history.</p>
    <hr class="stripped-border"></hr>
    <h1 class="title-parag">Why our solution is effective?</h1>
    <p class="text-parag">our solution will be effective because of how many platforms we have meaning more people will see our campaign and more will likely donate. As I said before, the solution is plausible even in the pandemic, so the problem we have this year and a year ago, won’t get in the way of our solution. </p>

    <p class="small-parag">-Proof that people can donate: Americans opened their hearts and wallets for another record-breaking Giving Tuesday. It's estimated that 35 million U.S. adults participated in 2021, with total gifts of $2.7 billion, a 9% increase from 2020.

More than eight in ten Indonesians have donated money in the past year and Indonesia's rate of volunteering is more than three times the global average. More than three billion people helped someone they didn’t know in 2020. </p>
    <br>
     <p class="small-parag">
  -How people would see our social media platform: More than half of the world now uses social media. 4.55 billion people around the world now use social media, 400 million new users have come online within the last 12 months. 5.29 billion unique mobile users mean more than two-thirds of the world have access to a mobile phone.

       <hr class="stripped-border"></hr>
       <h1 class="title-parag">WHY IT WORKS?</h1>
       <p class="text-parag" style="margin-left: 300px;margin-right: 300px;">It works when a large portion of people place attention on our website as people donate because of this for either boasting in ego and self-confidence or empathy for people who go through such a thing. They donate because of ego or empathy but this only happens because they give trust in the information you give. Giving people how far or how close they are to their goal also helps in making people donate.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="link-parag" style="margin-left: 300px;"><a>https://getfullyfunded.com/why-people-give/</a></p>
       <hr class="stripped-border"></hr>
       <h1 class="title-parag" style="font-size: 45px;">How do you know you truly helped poverty?</h1>
       <p class="text-parag">When the website receives a lot of attentions, more people would tend to donate, statistically. When this happens, the money we received will be transfered to various person that will distribute the money to people of poverty. Giving, is helping. We are merely the middle man for those who helps. Being the way of receiving for the donators to the donatee, is our main goal.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="text-parag">PLAN B: if donations don’t work, then we will rely on the people we have gathered on our social media platforms and spread more thoroughly.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="text-parag">PLAN C: if both donations and social media platforms don’t work, then we will help people without finances, (focus on the only funds we got and distribute them to the people and hold until we get more) and keep people that we would need to help that needs funds to help properly on hold and help those that we could help without funds (e.g people we can direct to work that they can manage or homeless people we can direct to government homeless shelters without needs of funds) until we get donations.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p class="text-parag">Create a social media page to find people willing to help, and make a webpage (with or without the people willing that is willing on help in that social media page) then reach out to those who are in need of help (people in poverty) separate their info, create a donation site and a campaign for them, find companies in need of people, find a homeless shelter and try our best giving the people in poverty a chance to lift a foot in life.
