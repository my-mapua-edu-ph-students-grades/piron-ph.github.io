										<p><strong>1.</strong>
											Typhoons are affected by landforms and bodies of water, based on how much energy they produce.
										</p>

										<p><strong>2.</strong>
											Bodies of water affected in the Philippines when the typhoon ulysses hit. Heavy rains caused by the typhoon overflowed rivers, causing severe flooding in Marikina. As the typhoon crossed the country, dams from all around Luzon neared their spilling points, forcing the dams to release large amounts of water into their impounds. As the Magat Dam approached its spilling point, all seven of its gates were opened to prevent dam failure, which overflowed the Cagayan River and caused widespread floods in Cagayan and Isabela. After entering the South China Sea, Vamco further intensified until it reached its brief peak as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon. On November 15, Vamco made landfall in Vietnam as a Category 1-equivalent typhoon before dissipating shortly after.
										</p>

										<p><strong>3.</strong>
											Typhoon Ulysses brought catastrophic winds and intense rain that affected the water bodies of the Philippines through not only flooding. The typhoon Ulysses also brought calamities to the landforms as it ravaged lands by destroying the trees through the flood dragging them through force. It also affected the landform through the landslide that caused the destruction of many property , it caused injuries and even death.
										</p>

										<p><strong>4.</strong>
											Typhoons gain energy from warm ocean water and lose energy over cold water, interaction with land will weaken a typhoon.
										</p>

										<p><strong>5.</strong>
											To make a powerful typhoon like Ulysses, you need warm/hot water since the higher the humidity, the more powerful the Storm/Typhoon. The storm will become stronger when typhoons are on bodies of water. Since the Philippines is in the Tropical zone, it’s often more Hot here, which means the ocean water will be hotter providing a source of heat and moisture for the typhoon. 
										</p>

										<p><strong>6.</strong>
											Typhoons are weakened by land masses, which might cause them to evaporate if the land mass is significant as the source of heat and moisture is cut off when on land, which is the warm ocean. Deep convection and the release of latent heat support typhoons, therefore warm ocean water is required to keep the convection and wind speeds going.
