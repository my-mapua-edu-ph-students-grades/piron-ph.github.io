											<li>What is the basic information of the region that has been greatly affected by the typhoon (This includes the geographical location, economic status, population, etc.)?
												<p>The typhoon Ulysses is one of the deadliest tropical cyclones to ever hit philippines. It made its first landfall in patnanungan quezon and they traveled west resulting in the hit of luzon , where manila suffered the worst flooding in years from november 11 to 12. This typhoon left damages of 12.9 million pesos wherein the affected areas were philippines , vietnam , laos and thailand having fatalities of 102 deaths, 85 injured and 10 missing individuals.</p>
											</li>
											<li>How was the community affected by the typhoon 
												<p>typhoon and many of their homes were destroyed, people can be injured, killed, and lost during the typhoon, and the flooding will cause the people to drown, property will be swept away, mudslides and electricity will be lost. </p>
											</li>
											<li> How did the community prepare for it? How did they recover?
												<p>
													The community started packing their vulnerable things such as clothes and foods and then started evacuating to the nearest evacuation center such as school or covered court, Although they are not much prepared  since if they are prepared there will be much less people who died and it just show the failure of the government on how did they respond to the typhoon. After the typhoon Ulysses exited the country it left many affect like broken homes and flooded city, People started helping each other to rebuild the broken homes, People started helping those people who are stucked at their houses because of the flood, Also people who are not that affected started giving food and donations to those people who are in need of those. 
												</p>
											</li>
											<li> How vulnerable are they to typhoons? 
												<p>The storm first made landfall in Patnanungan, Quezon, around 10:30 p.m. and then continued west to hit the island of Luzon, where Manila saw its worst flooding in years. A river in Marikina, located in the Manila metropolitan area, was reported to have risen a meter (3 feet) in less than three hours. As of November 12, several dams were in danger of overflowing due to the heavy rains. Tens of thousands of homes in low-lying suburbs of the national capital were submerged in roof-level floods, trapping residents in their rooftops while awaiting rescue. The rains also caused high turbidity of the water in Ipo Dam in Bulacan, leading to service interruptions as the concessionaire reduced the production in its water treatment plants. Nearly two million households were also without electricity as high winds toppled power lines. In conclusion… they were definitely VERY vulnerable.</p>
											</li>
											<li> Was there any damage? How severe were they?
												<p>Vamco impacted the Philippines and Vietnam just a few days after the strike of Typhoon Goni. Both countries were still attempting to recover from Goni's initial impact, but Vamco went on to quickly exceed Goni's record as the sixth-costliest Philippine typhoon on record; in total both typhoons caused ₱37.2 billion (US$770 million) in damage in the Philippines alone.</p>
											</li>
											<li> Was the typhoon accompanied by secondary disasters? How did they affect the community?
												<p>
													This typhoon not only had powerful winds and torrential rains that killed many, it was also accompanied by a secondary disaster which was flooding leading to the destruction of homes , loss of lives and many injuries.
												</p>
											</li>
											<li> Were there any positive impacts of the typhoon in the region? 
												<p>typhoons also have positive impacts like typhoon can increase nutrient concentration owing to river runoff and upwelling,it attracts fishes ,accumulate for foods.Dozens of people have died because of typhoon ulysses,destroyed many houses and many bad effects,people learned there lesson to prepare ,be ready and always watch news,to be aware what will happen.</p>
