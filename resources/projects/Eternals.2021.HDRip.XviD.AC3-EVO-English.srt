2
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:48,235
It is time.

3
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,689
It's beautiful, isn't it?

4
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:28,359
I'm Ikaris.

5
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,694
I'm Sersi.

6
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:48,142
Thank you, Ajak.

7
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:33,998
Shit.

8
00:07:37,543 --> 00:07:40,379
Excuse me. Excuse me.

9
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:00,941
I know I'm late, Charlie.

10
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,990
"In this broad Earth of ours,

11
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:11,493
"Amid the measureless grossness
and the slag,

12
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,872
"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,

13
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,625
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

14
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,378
The poet's hope and optimism in humanity...

15
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:26,008
echoes our recent universal victory,
the return of half our population...

16
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:27,259
And, thank God, there she is.

17
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,972
Our brilliant museum scientist, Ms. Sersi,
the person who will be...

18
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,683
and was always supposed to be
giving you your presentation today.

19
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:38,687
Thank you, Mr. Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

20
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:43,734
Today, we'll be learning about the importance
of apex predators in a balanced ecosystem.

21
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:46,070
Poetry?

22
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:49,782
I completely ran out of things to say,
and these kids make me nervous.

23
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:52,159
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

24
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:53,786
See you tonight.

25
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:55,913
Ooh! "See you tonight."

26
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:58,332
All right, settle down.

27
00:09:00,835 --> 00:09:01,836
So...

28
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,713
who can tell me what an apex predator is?

29
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:06,882
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

30
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,217
Very good.

31
00:09:08,384 --> 00:09:12,054
Apex predators do hunt their prey for food,
like all predators.

32
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:14,098
But one thing that sets them apart...

33
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:18,894
is that there are no other animals
in their habitat strong enough to hunt them.

34
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:21,480
Who can give me an example?

35
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:22,648
Lions.

36
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,567
-Wolves.
-Correct.

37
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,404
Earthquake.

38
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:32,825
Get down. Get down!

39
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:35,828
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

40
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,999
Let me help you.
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

41
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,967
It's all right. Come here.

42
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:54,096
You're all right. You're all right.

43
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:38,682
I like this song.

44
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:39,975
Me, too.

45
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:42,353
Do you wanna dance?

46
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:44,480
Wait, what the hell?

47
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:46,649
Your hand!

48
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,237
You've had too much to drink.
I gotta go.

49
00:10:56,367 --> 00:11:00,788
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

50
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:05,960
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dane</i>

51
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:10,089
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

52
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:12,216
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

53
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:20,641
Is this from the Middle Ages?

54
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:22,101
It has your family crest.

55
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:24,728
It must have cost a fortune.

56
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:26,522
I'm a good eBay bidder.

57
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:27,690
Thank you.

58
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,650
Happy birthday.

59
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:37,908
So, have you given any more thought
to us moving in together?

60
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:40,244
Yeah, I thought about it.

61
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:43,414
I can't move in with you.

62
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:45,416
Yeah. Thought you'd say that.

63
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,417
I'm sorry.

64
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:49,086
And I think I know why.

65
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,464
Are you a wizard?

66
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:53,966
What?

67
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,926
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

68
00:11:56,093 --> 00:11:57,094
No. I'm...

69
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:59,555
I've noticed some unusual things
happen when I'm around you.

70
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:02,808
Like our water always turns to coffee
whenever the waiter ignores us.

71
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:03,976
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

72
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:06,395
And Sprite says things...

73
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:10,065
like you and your ex-boyfriend
broke up a century ago.

74
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:11,692
She said that?

75
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:13,068
And he can fly.

76
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:15,154
He's a pilot.

77
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,115
Get a room, you two.

78
00:12:18,282 --> 00:12:20,743
Can we go now?
It's past my bedtime.

79
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:26,916
Are you really in love?

80
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:28,334
What if I am?

81
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,669
You better tell him the truth, then.

82
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,463
I'm working on it.

83
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:45,476
You guys wanna get pizza?

84
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:46,894
No, thank you!

85
00:12:48,771 --> 00:12:52,233
He won't live forever, you know.
Move in with him.

86
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:54,109
I live with you.

87
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:57,530
Dane.

88
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:02,117
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

89
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:03,911
Dane, run!

90
00:13:15,381 --> 00:13:16,549
-Sersi?
-Let's go.

91
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:20,636
-What is that thing?
-A Deviant!

92
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:21,971
You said you killed them all!

93
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:23,138
You told him that?

94
00:13:23,305 --> 00:13:24,932
-You believed me?
-I do now!

95
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:33,190
What are you doing?

96
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:34,400
Keep Dane safe!

97
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,443
Sersi, wait! What?

98
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,036
You're fine, dude.

99
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:47,329
Sprite!

100
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,461
No. Stairs.

101
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:34,210
Run! Go! Go!

102
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:35,753
-Go!
-Come on!

103
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:44,803
It knows where we are!

104
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,055
How?

105
00:14:46,222 --> 00:14:47,723
I don't know!

106
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,184
Sprite!

107
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:57,149
Sprite!

108
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:17,419
Ikaris!

109
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:20,506
Evening, ladies.

110
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:23,425
Watch out!

111
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,943
Wizard.

112
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:45,823
Sorry.

113
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:08,929
Did it just heal itself?

114
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:29,575
Ikaris.

115
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:33,245
It's good to see you.

116
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:35,539
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

117
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,464
I'm Dane.

118
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:45,049
Hello, Dane.

119
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,760
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

120
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:04,484
We're Eternals, from a planet called Olympia.

121
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:08,071
We came here 7,000 years ago on the <i>Domo...</i>

122
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:11,659
our starship,
to protect humans from the Deviants.

123
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:16,829
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago, but now they're back.

124
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,377
Look, if you don't want to move in with me,
you could just say.

125
00:17:21,544 --> 00:17:23,002
Dane, this is serious.

126
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,173
I know. I'm just still getting over
the fact you're not a wizard.

127
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,342
I was hoping you could change me
into a giraffe.

128
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,010
I always wanted to be a giraffe
when I was a kid.

129
00:17:30,177 --> 00:17:32,471
It's too bad I can't change sentient beings.

130
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:33,973
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

131
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:41,188
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

132
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,567
Or any war? Or all the other terrible things
throughout history?

133
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,319
We were instructed
not to interfere in any human conflicts...

134
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:48,529
unless Deviants were involved.

135
00:17:48,696 --> 00:17:49,905
Why?

136
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:55,244
If we'd protected humanity from everything
for 7,000 years...

137
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:59,290
you'd never have had the chance to
develop in the way you were meant to.

138
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:03,669
But if the Deviants were eradicated
a long time ago...

139
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,171
why are you still here?

140
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:06,422
We've been waiting...

141
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:08,924
to be told we can go home.

142
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,969
So...

143
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:14,013
Ikaris.

144
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:16,765
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

145
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,602
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

146
00:18:19,768 --> 00:18:22,062
In the fifth century BC?

147
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:23,898
How long were you two together?

148
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:25,566
5,000 years.

149
00:18:26,942 --> 00:18:28,944
I guess you can call that long-term.

150
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:31,447
What happened?

151
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:33,532
He left.

152
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,286
I always thought he'd come back, but...

153
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:39,538
he never did.

154
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,498
So, I moved on.

155
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:43,334
I'm glad you did.

156
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:45,377
I'm sorry.

157
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:48,297
I have to go.

158
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,975
<i>This morning,
an unprecedented global earthquake...</i>

159
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,727
<i>swept nation-states across the world...</i>

160
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:03,938
<i>causing damage and panic.</i>

161
00:19:04,104 --> 00:19:06,690
<i>Many have speculated its connection
with the Blip.</i>

162
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:09,109
<i>The UN has called for an emergency meeting...</i>

163
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,403
That Deviant healed itself.

164
00:19:12,404 --> 00:19:14,448
They could never do that before.

165
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,620
And it was coming after us instead of humans.
What's going on?

166
00:19:19,787 --> 00:19:22,498
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

167
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:24,750
That Deviant is news to me.

168
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:29,588
Something's happening to Earth.

169
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,675
Can't be a coincidence.

170
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:35,928
We need to find the others.

171
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,514
I haven't seen some of them for centuries.

172
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:40,599
I doubt much has changed.

173
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:53,612
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

174
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:01,120
But we need to stick together.

175
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:04,582
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

176
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,877
Let's go to Ajak first.

177
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:10,754
She'll know what to do.

178
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,302
You hear that, Sprite?

179
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:18,971
Family reunion.

180
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:20,848
It's about time.

181
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:35,237
Hey, that one was mine!
Never mind.

182
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:11,584
Ajak.

183
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:13,752
Arishem.

184
00:22:14,628 --> 00:22:17,798
We continue to keep Babylon safe
from the Deviants.

185
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:20,467
More people have come to seek refuge.

186
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:23,387
It is now the largest city on Earth.

187
00:22:23,554 --> 00:22:26,390
The Eternals serving their missions
across the galaxies...

188
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,267
will learn from your success.

189
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:29,810
Thank you.

190
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:36,066
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

191
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:40,863
But I have noticed something special
about this planet.

192
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,285
And I fear that maybe this time
the cost may...

193
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:49,163
Do not become attached to this planet.

194
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,167
You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.

195
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:56,086
I understand.

196
00:22:57,338 --> 00:22:59,173
I will not let you down.

197
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:24,907
Phastos.

198
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:27,993
Did you go to the party last night
like I told you to?

199
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,161
The party, yeah.

200
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:30,829
-Yeah, it was...
-He worked all night.

201
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:32,248
Who was talking to you?

202
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:34,583
Get a life.
And where is Sersi?

203
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,751
Late as usual.

204
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:38,921
I'm sorry, but I have something
very exciting to show you, okay?

205
00:23:39,964 --> 00:23:41,799
Wait till you see this.

206
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:46,595
What is it?

207
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:48,305
It's an engine.

208
00:23:48,472 --> 00:23:51,517
It moves steam from high pressure
to low pressure.

209
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:54,728
It'll help them till their fields
at an incredibly fast rate.

210
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:56,272
It's gonna freak them out.

211
00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:59,275
I mean, they only have
had the wheel 1,000 years, so...

212
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:04,363
You know, we could do that thing
where you use your mind to control them...

213
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,531
and then they could do it quicker.

214
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:06,949
Ajak, you listening to this?

215
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,952
Phastos, this steam...

216
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,121
-Engine. It's a steam engine.
-It's too soon.

217
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:13,706
And there she is.

218
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:15,583
What did I miss?

219
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:19,795
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

220
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:21,881
I am sure you have something simpler.

221
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:22,882
Simple.

222
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:24,633
Okay, let's see.

223
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:28,929
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

224
00:24:30,264 --> 00:24:31,599
the plow.

225
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,560
'Cause that's what it does.

226
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:36,020
Plows dirt.

227
00:24:36,187 --> 00:24:39,440
I met another group of settlers who are
building their homes in the northern fields.

228
00:24:39,607 --> 00:24:40,983
They'll need to plant their own crops.

229
00:24:41,525 --> 00:24:43,110
-Thanks, Sersi.
-Listen...

230
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:47,156
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

231
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:52,870
But there is no telling what wonders
they will discover as they advance.

232
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:24,026
I just saw that.

233
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:26,070
There's so many other chairs, man.

234
00:25:26,237 --> 00:25:27,404
You know, I could use my powers...

235
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:29,156
Come and have a drink with me.

236
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:30,616
No.

237
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:32,535
I can't let you go
and fight Deviants on your own.

238
00:25:32,701 --> 00:25:34,870
-We need to guard the city.
-Get out of my way.

239
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:38,499
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

240
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:42,419
We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.

241
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,840
Thena.

242
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:50,678
It's an honor to fight alongside you.

243
00:25:52,304 --> 00:25:53,556
And you.

244
00:25:57,101 --> 00:26:00,145
My beautiful Makkari. You're late.

245
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:59,121
Well, she also says that
stealing is very, very bad.

246
00:27:06,212 --> 00:27:07,338
Deal.

247
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,894
I promise I won't let my feelings for Sersi
distract me from my mission.

248
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:25,231
Humans are far from being able to
protect themselves from the Deviants.

249
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,316
We still have much to do.

250
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:30,986
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

251
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,072
I can feel it.

252
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:37,284
But you are allowed to live a life, you know?

253
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:40,329
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

254
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:07,731
Try.

255
00:28:09,358 --> 00:28:11,360
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

256
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:15,990
Well, not bad.

257
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:51,275
It matches your eyes.

258
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:56,155
You're learning their language now?

259
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:58,449
If I want to spend more time with you...

260
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:00,576
I need to get to know them.

261
00:29:06,957 --> 00:29:07,958
Wait, what did I say?

262
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:11,337
You said, "I am very beautiful."

263
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:15,549
You...

264
00:29:18,344 --> 00:29:21,055
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

265
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:34,527
I'm yours, Sersi...

266
00:29:35,694 --> 00:29:36,695
if you'll have me.

267
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:23,242
I love you, Ikaris.

268
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:27,663
I love you, Sersi.

269
00:31:35,105 --> 00:31:36,398
Hello?

270
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:41,237
Ajak?

271
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,638
Ajak!

272
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:35,249
It was a Deviant.

273
00:32:42,673 --> 00:32:45,092
<i>Our love</i>

274
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:48,596
<i>And our devotion</i>

275
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:54,268
<i>Were as deep as any ocean</i>

276
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,275
It was the last time I saw her.

277
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:07,323
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,
so I went to London.

278
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:12,953
Turned out, both of us were lonely
and we needed each other.

279
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:16,790
I guess, in her way...

280
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:19,960
Ajak never stopped trying to take care of us.

281
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:29,887
Bye, Ajak.

282
00:33:34,475 --> 00:33:36,977
It's the first time in 7,000 years
one of us has died.

283
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,064
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London...

284
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:42,024
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

285
00:33:42,191 --> 00:33:43,901
Deviants have never done that in the past.

286
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:46,111
It healed itself just like Ajak.

287
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:49,198
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

288
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:17,059
Arishem.

289
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:18,185
Sersi.

290
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:19,978
It is almost time.

291
00:34:21,856 --> 00:34:24,065
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

292
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,110
What happened, Sersi?

293
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:31,739
The sphere
that Ajak used to talk with Arishem...

294
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:34,409
it came out of her body and went inside me.

295
00:34:34,577 --> 00:34:36,286
Did you talk with Arishem?

296
00:34:36,911 --> 00:34:38,539
Yes. He said...

297
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:40,875
it's almost time.

298
00:34:42,126 --> 00:34:43,835
Can you try talking to him again?

299
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,213
I don't know how.

300
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,257
But she chose you to replace her.

301
00:34:48,924 --> 00:34:50,176
And she gave you the sphere.

302
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:51,427
Hold on, Sprite.

303
00:34:53,137 --> 00:34:54,554
Are you sure you talked with Arishem?

304
00:34:54,722 --> 00:34:56,015
What else would it be?

305
00:34:57,266 --> 00:34:58,517
Mahd Wy'ry.

306
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:36,055
Where are the others?

307
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,477
There were more Deviants than you said.

308
00:35:41,644 --> 00:35:43,312
Well, I'm sure that was a lot of fun for you.

309
00:35:43,646 --> 00:35:44,855
It was.

310
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:49,109
Once the others kill these last Deviants...

311
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,112
we will have eliminated them all
from the planet.

312
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,549
Don't.

313
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:15,344
We don't interfere in their wars.

314
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,013
This isn't war.

315
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,974
It's genocide.

316
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:22,393
Their weapons have become too deadly.

317
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:26,939
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
helping them advance, Phastos.

318
00:36:27,147 --> 00:36:30,693
Technology is a part of
their evolutionary process, Druig.

319
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,403
It's not exactly something that I can stop.

320
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,572
No, you can't. But I can.

321
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:38,325
It's too late.

322
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:40,953
-Thena?
-Everyone is going to die.

323
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,080
Are you okay?

324
00:36:44,498 --> 00:36:45,499
Thena?

325
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:50,588
-Thena? Thena, no!
-Thena!

326
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:22,119
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

327
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,080
Listen to my voice.

328
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,459
You are safe.

329
00:37:29,585 --> 00:37:32,171
You are loved.

330
00:37:33,088 --> 00:37:34,882
You're our Thena.

331
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:43,349
Hey, Thena!

332
00:37:43,516 --> 00:37:45,768
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

333
00:38:04,078 --> 00:38:05,663
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

334
00:38:06,956 --> 00:38:08,082
Sersi.

335
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:09,250
Thena, please.

336
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,335
Come back to us.

337
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:13,045
Okay.

338
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,730
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

339
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,819
There is no cure...

340
00:38:37,695 --> 00:38:39,154
so no one really talks about it.

341
00:38:43,993 --> 00:38:44,994
What happened?

342
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,245
Thena.

343
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:47,955
You attacked everyone.

344
00:38:48,372 --> 00:38:50,749
Wounded Sersi, Phastos...

345
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,877
you nearly killed Makkari.

346
00:38:55,337 --> 00:38:57,173
I don't remember.

347
00:38:57,339 --> 00:38:59,425
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

348
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:03,762
Your mind is fracturing
under the weight of your memories.

349
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:08,184
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

350
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,563
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship...

351
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,566
where we have the technology to help you.

352
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:20,112
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

353
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:21,780
She could have killed all of us.

354
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:22,948
Please.

355
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:27,119
Please, I want to remember.

356
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:30,039
I want to remember my life.

357
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:32,166
Thena, I love you.

358
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,959
But listen to me.

359
00:39:34,126 --> 00:39:37,713
It's not important if you remember or not.

360
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:40,007
Your spirit will remain.

361
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:42,968
You will always be Thena deep inside.

362
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:44,428
Trust me.

363
00:39:44,595 --> 00:39:45,846
Why should she trust you?

364
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,267
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

365
00:39:50,434 --> 00:39:52,269
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

366
00:39:52,436 --> 00:39:53,479
Upset?

367
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:58,692
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,
and look where you've gotten us.

368
00:40:00,194 --> 00:40:05,199
I've watched humans destroy each other
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

369
00:40:06,992 --> 00:40:09,745
Do you know what that does to someone
after centuries?

370
00:40:11,038 --> 00:40:13,123
Could our mission have been a mistake?

371
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:17,127
Are we really helping these people
build a better world, huh?

372
00:40:26,178 --> 00:40:28,556
We're just like the soldiers down there.

373
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,559
Pawns to their leaders.

374
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:34,311
Blinded by loyalty.

375
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:39,066
It ends now.

376
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:57,835
Let them go.

377
00:40:58,002 --> 00:40:59,336
You're gonna have to make me.

378
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:00,504
Stop.

379
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:08,596
If you wanna stop me...

380
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:11,765
you're gonna have to kill me.

381
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:37,333
I'll watch over Thena.

382
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:39,126
Let her keep her memories.

383
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:42,421
One day, when she attacks you...

384
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,090
you might have to kill her.

385
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:52,973
We'll take that chance.

386
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:03,943
You may all go.

387
00:42:06,403 --> 00:42:08,113
The Deviants are gone.

388
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:11,951
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

389
00:42:12,117 --> 00:42:13,702
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

390
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:15,704
We're a team, we should stay together.

391
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:18,791
I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris.

392
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:21,293
Do not forget your place.

393
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:26,757
This is where we say goodbye.

394
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:29,468
You are free to go.

395
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:33,013
I want you to go out there.

396
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,933
And live a life for yourselves.

397
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,852
Not as soldiers.

398
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:41,522
Not with the purpose
you were given.

399
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:44,692
Find your own purpose.

400
00:42:45,568 --> 00:42:49,738
And one day, when we see each other again...

401
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,202
I want you to tell me what you found.

402
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:01,500
<i>Come my way</i>

403
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,171
{\an8}<i>Get the evil away</i>

404
00:43:06,547 --> 00:43:08,757
<i>You came to save</i>

405
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:12,511
<i>And now you're here</i>

406
00:43:15,973 --> 00:43:19,435
<i>Now you have come home
Give it all to me</i>

407
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:23,314
<i>You would risk it all
For my victory</i>

408
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,401
<i>Waiting for you
Scarcely can I</i>

409
00:44:05,147 --> 00:44:07,441
I am Karun Patel.

410
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:09,318
Kingo's valet.

411
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:13,531
It's truly an honor to be in the presence
of the great Eternals.

412
00:44:15,324 --> 00:44:18,786
<i>The ring of fire
Like the sun</i>

413
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:22,623
<i>You have risen
Mighty one</i>

414
00:44:31,674 --> 00:44:34,802
Cut! Okay, everyone, that was good.

415
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:36,720
But we could do 10% better.

416
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:38,973
That was beautiful. Very, very good.

417
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:40,140
Really, so good.

418
00:44:41,225 --> 00:44:43,310
My friends from college are here.

419
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:44,854
Hello, boss!

420
00:44:45,563 --> 00:44:48,148
Perfect timing! Welcome to the set of...

421
00:44:51,277 --> 00:44:52,361
I'm playing you!

422
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:54,196
-You like the costume?
-We need to talk.

423
00:44:54,363 --> 00:44:55,698
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

424
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:57,032
We need to talk to you in private.

425
00:44:57,658 --> 00:45:01,120
Oh, Karun, he's worked with me for 50 years.
I trust him completely.

426
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:03,706
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire...

427
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:05,165
and he tried to stake me through the heart.

428
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,418
I have apologized so many times.

429
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:10,171
Not quite enough times. Very close, though.
I'll let you know.

430
00:45:10,337 --> 00:45:13,340
I have to get ready for the next scene.
Come to my tent, we'll talk there.

431
00:45:13,507 --> 00:45:14,675
You guys are gonna love the next scene.

432
00:45:14,842 --> 00:45:17,761
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

433
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:19,680
Wait, are we getting back together?

434
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:20,848
We need to talk.

435
00:45:21,015 --> 00:45:21,974
I've been waiting for the day...

436
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:24,310
the world learns the true identity
of the Shadow Warrior.

437
00:45:24,476 --> 00:45:25,936
Ajak's dead.

438
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:32,401
She was killed.

439
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:34,695
It was a Deviant.

440
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:40,868
The Deviants are back.

441
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:42,494
We don't know how many there are.

442
00:45:46,415 --> 00:45:47,833
You need to come with us.

443
00:46:04,058 --> 00:46:06,185
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

444
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:08,896
We just started shooting this movie.
It's the first of a trilogy.

445
00:46:09,522 --> 00:46:11,524
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

446
00:46:13,108 --> 00:46:14,276
Sir...

447
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:16,654
-may I say something?
-Please don't say anything.

448
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:17,863
I think you should go.

449
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,240
I just said don't say anything.

450
00:46:19,406 --> 00:46:23,661
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

451
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:26,497
Remember? It's your favorite line...

452
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:31,168
from <i>The Shadow Warrior 2: Voyage of Time.</i>

453
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:33,754
Your family needs you.

454
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:46,851
Seven thousand years.

455
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:52,356
That's how long the battle between Eternals
and Deviants has raged for.

456
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:54,984
You think I'm a movie star.

457
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,987
<i>Well, I am. But I am also...</i>

458
00:46:58,904 --> 00:47:00,489
<i>an Eternal.</i>

459
00:47:00,656 --> 00:47:02,157
<i>Kingo, what are you doing?</i>

460
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:06,287
I think we should be remembered, so...

461
00:47:06,453 --> 00:47:10,499
I am making a documentary about us.

462
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:13,669
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

463
00:47:13,836 --> 00:47:16,046
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

464
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:17,548
Oh, wait.

465
00:47:21,427 --> 00:47:23,929
<i>Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.</i>

466
00:47:24,597 --> 00:47:26,807
This is Sersi.

467
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,392
Sersi...

468
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,394
tell them about yourself.

469
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:33,647
<i>We're rolling.</i>

470
00:47:33,814 --> 00:47:34,648
<i>Well...</i>

471
00:47:36,317 --> 00:47:40,905
I can change a rock into water.

472
00:47:41,697 --> 00:47:44,200
I could turn a rock into wood.

473
00:47:44,366 --> 00:47:46,452
Or a rock into metal.

474
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:48,787
Actually, one time, I turned a rock into air.

475
00:47:48,954 --> 00:47:49,830
Cut.

476
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:54,043
You know what? Why don't you think about it,
and we'll get back to you, okay?

477
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,461
Let's go.

478
00:47:58,172 --> 00:48:00,508
Sprite says you're addicted to this thing.

479
00:48:02,635 --> 00:48:03,802
Oh, this?

480
00:48:04,678 --> 00:48:06,180
Look at this.

481
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:11,143
You know, seeing as we don't age.

482
00:48:11,644 --> 00:48:13,479
I think you look quite good.

483
00:48:15,064 --> 00:48:16,065
Don't you?

484
00:48:20,236 --> 00:48:24,114
Nobody ever wonders how you managed to be
the leading man for over 100 years?

485
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:25,824
I don't know what you're talking about.

486
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:28,160
That is my great-great-grandfather...

487
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:30,663
that is my great-grandfather...

488
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:31,830
grandfather...

489
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:34,041
father, and me.

490
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:37,211
I'm part of the greatest dynasty
in the history of Bollywood.

491
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,671
Pretty impressive, right?

492
00:48:38,838 --> 00:48:40,881
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

493
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:46,095
Okay, I got sick of moving every five years.

494
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:49,223
People freak out
when they notice that you don't...

495
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:52,309
age.

496
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:55,020
I thought we were friends.

497
00:49:02,027 --> 00:49:03,904
Do you know why I love movies?

498
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,365
Because of you.

499
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:09,326
I missed sitting in the audience,
listening to your stories...

500
00:49:09,493 --> 00:49:10,744
watching your illusions.

501
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,793
We should've all stayed together.

502
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:21,881
Ajak would still be alive.

503
00:49:23,465 --> 00:49:25,259
She should have never let us go.

504
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:37,897
This is the Deviant you fought in London?

505
00:49:38,314 --> 00:49:39,732
It's different.

506
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,568
There must be more out there than we thought.

507
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:46,155
Is this a Deviant, sir?

508
00:49:46,322 --> 00:49:47,364
Yep.

509
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:49,992
It's a beautiful creature.

510
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,621
What? This? This?
No. It's hideous.

511
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:56,415
You've never had one
try to bite your head off. Roll.

512
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,295
You're about to meet two of the
greatest warriors the world has ever known.

513
00:50:01,754 --> 00:50:05,174
<i>Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.</i>

514
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:07,051
And her trusty friend...

515
00:50:07,218 --> 00:50:08,302
Door.

516
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:10,930
...a mighty powerhouse of strength...

517
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:14,058
<i>the fearsome Gilgamesh!</i>

518
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,603
Gilgamesh!

519
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:22,191
<i>What took you so long?</i>

520
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:27,112
You look younger today, Sprite.

521
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:28,781
I have the same apron.

522
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:30,574
Who the hell are you?

523
00:50:30,991 --> 00:50:33,077
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

524
00:50:33,702 --> 00:50:36,330
Oh, valet. Like Alfred in <i>Batman.</i>

525
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:39,166
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

526
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,919
No shit. I could have used some help.

527
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:44,547
We were attacked by a Deviant in London, too.

528
00:50:44,713 --> 00:50:46,465
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

529
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:48,342
You couldn't?

530
00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:50,511
I was distracted.

531
00:50:50,678 --> 00:50:51,971
Sure, man.

532
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:55,474
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

533
00:50:57,768 --> 00:50:59,353
I'm sorry, Gil.

534
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,397
Ajak's dead.

535
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,526
It's true, buddy.

536
00:51:06,068 --> 00:51:07,403
We lost her.

537
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:40,561
Sersi.

538
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:43,856
The attack triggered her.

539
00:51:44,023 --> 00:51:45,941
She's no fun to be around right now.

540
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:49,028
Hey, Thena.

541
00:51:49,445 --> 00:51:51,322
Look who's here.

542
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:53,365
Give me your hand.

543
00:51:56,118 --> 00:51:57,161
Thena.

544
00:51:57,578 --> 00:52:00,331
Everyone in Centuri-6 is going to die.

545
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,082
Give me your hand.

546
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:04,460
It's too late. We can't save them.

547
00:52:04,627 --> 00:52:05,503
Thena.

548
00:52:12,551 --> 00:52:13,802
Thena.

549
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:17,223
We came to Earth together on our ship.

550
00:52:19,517 --> 00:52:21,227
You're an Eternal.

551
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:24,813
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

552
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,066
The legendary protector of Athens.

553
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:30,486
The goddess of war.

554
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:34,823
Remember who you are.

555
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:44,333
Remember.

556
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:02,184
-Thena.
-Hi.

557
00:53:03,143 --> 00:53:04,144
Hello.

558
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,480
Hey, who's your gardener?

559
00:53:07,982 --> 00:53:10,192
This is just what you guys eat every day?

560
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:11,944
-Yeah, this is amazing.
-Every day.

561
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:14,196
-Thank you for this.
-Oh, you're welcome.

562
00:53:14,363 --> 00:53:15,531
Help yourself.

563
00:53:15,698 --> 00:53:18,868
This one is a trio of wine, beer, and mead.

564
00:53:19,034 --> 00:53:21,495
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

565
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:23,747
That's so thoughtful.

566
00:53:30,546 --> 00:53:32,131
Should she be drinking?

567
00:53:33,382 --> 00:53:36,802
No, hers is non-alcoholic. For kids.

568
00:53:38,888 --> 00:53:41,056
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

569
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:44,685
For kids.

570
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,230
I was just kidding.

571
00:53:48,397 --> 00:53:51,775
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you...

572
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:55,070
after we helped defeat Laufey's army
in Tonsberg.

573
00:53:55,237 --> 00:53:56,322
What?

574
00:53:57,656 --> 00:53:58,657
I'm a big baby.

575
00:53:58,824 --> 00:54:00,701
Very mature. Can you stop?

576
00:54:01,577 --> 00:54:02,912
-Stop.
-Speaking of Odin...

577
00:54:03,078 --> 00:54:05,664
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

578
00:54:05,831 --> 00:54:08,459
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

579
00:54:08,626 --> 00:54:10,961
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone...

580
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:13,088
who do you think is gonna lead the Avengers?

581
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:15,257
I could lead them.

582
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:16,634
I figure I'd be good at that.

583
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,635
Yeah, you would.

584
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:20,012
Ajak didn't even choose you to lead us.

585
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:22,598
Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

586
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:23,766
-Harsh.
-I'm gonna let that one slide...

587
00:54:23,933 --> 00:54:26,477
because, you know, you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

588
00:54:26,644 --> 00:54:27,853
So what, you can fly.

589
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,730
I'm better-looking, everybody knows that.

590
00:54:29,897 --> 00:54:30,898
Where you going?

591
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,568
I'm just gonna get some air.

592
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:41,825
This is really good, Gil.

593
00:54:41,992 --> 00:54:45,204
You know, I could sell this.
Put my face on it, move some units.

594
00:54:45,371 --> 00:54:46,664
I made it from corn.

595
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:50,668
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

596
00:55:04,723 --> 00:55:07,560
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

597
00:55:07,893 --> 00:55:09,687
Yeah, it's a planet.

598
00:55:10,604 --> 00:55:14,233
She thinks she used to live there
until it was destroyed.

599
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,070
Always talks about
massive quakes ripping it apart.

600
00:55:18,237 --> 00:55:20,155
Everyone died, including herself.

601
00:55:20,573 --> 00:55:23,242
We had an unprecedented global earthquake
three days ago.

602
00:55:23,909 --> 00:55:25,744
Oh, that's what that was.

603
00:55:25,911 --> 00:55:27,663
I thought I was drunk.

604
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:30,583
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

605
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,878
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

606
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:35,921
I've tried so many times.

607
00:55:37,131 --> 00:55:39,216
Maybe you're trying too hard.

608
00:55:40,176 --> 00:55:42,761
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

609
00:56:30,226 --> 00:56:31,352
Sersi.

610
00:56:32,228 --> 00:56:33,312
Arishem.

611
00:56:33,896 --> 00:56:35,773
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

612
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,359
We think it absorbed her power.

613
00:56:38,526 --> 00:56:41,278
And something unusual is happening to Earth.

614
00:56:41,445 --> 00:56:44,448
It is a side effect of the emergence.

615
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:47,493
The emergence?

616
00:56:48,244 --> 00:56:52,414
It is time for you to learn
the true purpose of your mission.

617
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:57,920
You were sent to Earth to
bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

618
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:03,801
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

619
00:57:04,385 --> 00:57:08,889
I plant Celestial seeds into host planets
across the universe.

620
00:57:11,016 --> 00:57:14,895
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

621
00:57:20,276 --> 00:57:21,902
<i>In order to grow...</i>

622
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:25,906
<i>Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy
from intelligent life.</i>

623
00:57:26,907 --> 00:57:30,411
<i>The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans...</i>

624
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:33,247
<i>until the Eternals eliminated them.</i>

625
00:57:33,873 --> 00:57:39,795
<i>Now, the human population of this planet
has reached the required amount.</i>

626
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:43,007
<i>It is time for the emergence to begin.</i>

627
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:04,069
But...

628
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:07,114
everyone on Earth will die.

629
00:58:08,782 --> 00:58:11,869
The end of one life, Sersi...

630
00:58:13,245 --> 00:58:16,040
<i>is the beginning of another.</i>

631
00:58:28,886 --> 00:58:32,765
<i>Our universe
is a constant exchange of energy.</i>

632
00:58:33,766 --> 00:58:37,811
<i>An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.</i>

633
00:58:38,729 --> 00:58:40,981
<i>Celestials use energy...</i>

634
00:58:41,148 --> 00:58:44,235
<i>gathered from host planets to create suns...</i>

635
00:58:44,902 --> 00:58:48,155
<i>generating gravity, heat, and light...</i>

636
00:58:48,322 --> 00:58:50,824
<i>for new galaxies to form.</i>

637
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:57,456
<i>Without us...</i>

638
00:58:57,623 --> 00:59:00,793
<i>our universe will fall into darkness.</i>

639
00:59:03,546 --> 00:59:05,422
All life will die.

640
00:59:06,632 --> 00:59:08,384
Ajak knew the truth?

641
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:13,681
She has helped many Celestials
to emerge over millions of years.

642
00:59:13,848 --> 00:59:15,558
So have you.

643
00:59:17,935 --> 00:59:19,812
Earth was my first mission.

644
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:25,401
I was home, on Olympia.

645
00:59:26,777 --> 00:59:29,196
There is no Olympia.

646
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:50,342
This is your true home, Sersi.

647
00:59:51,385 --> 00:59:53,095
The World Forge.

648
00:59:55,931 --> 01:00:00,186
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

649
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,182
Everything dies except us...

650
01:00:39,475 --> 01:00:41,519
because we were never alive.

651
01:00:45,731 --> 01:00:47,525
Why don't I remember any of this?

652
01:00:57,952 --> 01:01:02,581
Because your memories are erased and reset
after each emergence.

653
01:01:03,707 --> 01:01:05,251
They are stored here.

654
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:09,588
Why do you keep them?

655
01:01:10,256 --> 01:01:13,676
I keep them in order to study the Deviants.

656
01:01:14,802 --> 01:01:17,388
I created the Deviants, Sersi...

657
01:01:17,555 --> 01:01:20,474
for the same purpose I created you.

658
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:25,396
<i>Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.</i>

659
01:01:29,108 --> 01:01:32,278
<i>I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them...</i>

660
01:01:32,444 --> 01:01:34,989
<i>so intelligent life could grow.</i>

661
01:01:40,536 --> 01:01:43,205
<i>But there was a flaw in their design.</i>

662
01:01:44,415 --> 01:01:45,749
<i>They evolved.</i>

663
01:01:45,916 --> 01:01:47,960
<i>Became predators themselves.</i>

664
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,131
And I lost control of them.

665
01:01:54,216 --> 01:01:57,219
I built and programmed you, Eternals...

666
01:01:57,386 --> 01:02:01,223
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution...

667
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:03,559
to correct my mistake.

668
01:02:05,561 --> 01:02:09,982
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place...

669
01:02:10,149 --> 01:02:12,401
as the Prime Eternal.

670
01:02:12,985 --> 01:02:14,778
Do not fail me.

671
01:02:33,255 --> 01:02:35,883
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

672
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:39,345
And our past memories are stored somewhere...

673
01:02:40,137 --> 01:02:41,722
in space?

674
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:44,225
And Arishem made the Deviants.

675
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,811
I'm sorry, Thena.

676
01:02:47,978 --> 01:02:49,396
You tried to warn us.

677
01:02:49,563 --> 01:02:53,567
The last time Arishem reset your memories,
something must have gone wrong.

678
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:55,361
What do you mean?

679
01:02:55,528 --> 01:02:58,864
Well, that's what Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

680
01:02:59,031 --> 01:03:02,535
All this time, Thena was remembering
all the other planets we were sent to...

681
01:03:02,701 --> 01:03:04,787
and everyone dying during the emergence.

682
01:03:05,246 --> 01:03:06,705
I thought we were heroes.

683
01:03:07,373 --> 01:03:08,707
Turns out we're the bad guys.

684
01:03:08,874 --> 01:03:11,168
We're not the bad guys, okay?

685
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:14,213
We've helped the Celestials
expand life across the universe.

686
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:17,550
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

687
01:03:17,716 --> 01:03:20,636
Every time innocent lives
have been sacrificed for the greater good...

688
01:03:20,803 --> 01:03:22,847
it turns out to be a mistake.

689
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:25,140
We have to stop the emergence.

690
01:03:25,307 --> 01:03:28,936
Sersi, we have no right
to stop the birth of a Celestial.

691
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:31,981
There has to be a way Tiamut can emerge
without destroying the Earth.

692
01:03:33,065 --> 01:03:36,277
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

693
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:39,321
Could Druig control its mind?

694
01:03:39,488 --> 01:03:41,740
Maybe put it to sleep?

695
01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:43,033
"Put it to sleep"?

696
01:03:43,492 --> 01:03:44,618
Are you serious?

697
01:03:44,785 --> 01:03:47,288
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

698
01:03:48,622 --> 01:03:50,332
So I could take a vacation to Fiji, you know?

699
01:03:50,499 --> 01:03:53,210
-We're talking about a Celestial, okay?
-We have to try.

700
01:03:53,377 --> 01:03:56,714
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

701
01:03:56,881 --> 01:03:58,215
Right.

702
01:04:00,134 --> 01:04:03,053
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

703
01:04:07,558 --> 01:04:08,934
And do what?

704
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,187
Watch TV?

705
01:04:11,353 --> 01:04:14,857
When I could be
with the Earth's original superheroes...

706
01:04:15,024 --> 01:04:17,443
as they try to save the world?

707
01:04:18,277 --> 01:04:19,486
Fine.

708
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:22,198
If you want to, stay.

709
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:24,116
Thank you very much, sir.

710
01:04:25,826 --> 01:04:27,036
Gilgamesh...

711
01:04:27,203 --> 01:04:28,746
could you please get rid of the saliva beer?

712
01:04:28,913 --> 01:04:30,206
I thought you liked it, man.

713
01:04:30,372 --> 01:04:32,374
We need to go. Now.

714
01:04:33,209 --> 01:04:34,585
Find the others.

715
01:04:34,919 --> 01:04:36,170
Once we're all together...

716
01:04:36,337 --> 01:04:39,048
we'll decide what to do about the emergence.

717
01:05:12,998 --> 01:05:14,583
It's very nice here, sir.

718
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,043
Don't be fooled.

719
01:05:17,169 --> 01:05:19,255
Ignorance is bliss.

720
01:05:35,229 --> 01:05:36,438
Hello, Sprite.

721
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,156
I missed all of you.

722
01:05:49,118 --> 01:05:53,038
Please, make yourselves at home.

723
01:05:57,877 --> 01:06:00,880
You've given me a lot of bad news
in one go, my lady.

724
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,798
Will you help us?

725
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:04,300
I am glad that...

726
01:06:11,432 --> 01:06:12,558
Hey, what's your service?

727
01:06:13,017 --> 01:06:14,518
I'm not getting any bars.

728
01:06:16,228 --> 01:06:19,565
Do you all remember this forest?
Beautiful.

729
01:06:20,733 --> 01:06:22,776
It was the last place we all lived together.

730
01:06:24,236 --> 01:06:27,198
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now...

731
01:06:27,364 --> 01:06:30,367
from the outside world and from themselves.

732
01:06:30,534 --> 01:06:35,247
Your kind, my friend, you will be responsible
for your own extinction one day.

733
01:06:35,789 --> 01:06:37,333
Don't you think?

734
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:40,961
I think we must learn from our mistakes
and do better, sir.

735
01:06:41,128 --> 01:06:43,005
You must not give up hope.

736
01:06:45,925 --> 01:06:47,343
Oh, no, you didn't.

737
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:50,012
Okay, new rule,
no more possessing people's valets.

738
01:06:50,179 --> 01:06:51,639
Where is your sense of humor, Kingo?

739
01:06:51,805 --> 01:06:52,806
I'm sorry, sir.

740
01:06:52,973 --> 01:06:55,184
Don't apologize, it's not your fault.

741
01:06:55,935 --> 01:06:58,562
You are not a god.
You know that, right?

742
01:06:58,729 --> 01:07:02,358
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

743
01:07:02,525 --> 01:07:04,109
I've directed some things, too.

744
01:07:04,276 --> 01:07:05,653
Oh, yeah? Like what?

745
01:07:06,278 --> 01:07:07,863
Some Internet content.

746
01:07:08,614 --> 01:07:09,615
How many views?

747
01:07:09,782 --> 01:07:11,700
I don't do it for the views.

748
01:07:11,867 --> 01:07:13,661
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

749
01:07:13,827 --> 01:07:16,121
-We need him.
-Ikaris.

750
01:07:17,164 --> 01:07:18,249
I missed you.

751
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:21,252
Are you gonna charm me or threaten me?

752
01:07:21,418 --> 01:07:23,462
I mean, there's a third option,
if you prefer that.

753
01:07:23,629 --> 01:07:26,507
It must be heartbreaking to find out
that you're not Mother's favorite.

754
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:28,342
And I'm sure she'd be real proud
of what you've been up to.

755
01:07:28,509 --> 01:07:29,510
Druig, this is serious.

756
01:07:29,677 --> 01:07:31,470
I'll tell you what's serious.

757
01:07:32,388 --> 01:07:36,350
I've just been told I've been sent on
a suicide mission for the past 7,000 years...

758
01:07:36,517 --> 01:07:39,895
and that my entire existence is a lie.

759
01:07:43,065 --> 01:07:46,402
So, excuse me for not giving a shit
about your plan right now.

760
01:07:51,282 --> 01:07:52,700
Druig sucks.

761
01:07:52,867 --> 01:07:54,493
He does, sir.

762
01:08:14,971 --> 01:08:16,724
I don't like this place.

763
01:08:17,183 --> 01:08:20,394
Druig needs to think,
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

764
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,770
we wait.

765
01:08:23,647 --> 01:08:27,484
I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

766
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:30,779
Those were the good old days.

767
01:08:32,656 --> 01:08:35,201
What if I can't fight anymore?

768
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:37,912
Of course you can.

769
01:08:38,953 --> 01:08:40,997
What if I hurt you again?

770
01:08:41,372 --> 01:08:46,587
Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

771
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:52,843
Thank you.

772
01:08:54,303 --> 01:08:55,554
For what?

773
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:59,642
For always taking care of me.

774
01:09:02,019 --> 01:09:03,729
I'd do it again.

775
01:09:06,564 --> 01:09:08,526
On any planet.

776
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:29,129
I like watching him, too.

777
01:09:29,296 --> 01:09:30,464
Jeez.

778
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,216
I don't think it's creepy at all.

779
01:09:35,845 --> 01:09:37,680
Have you read <i>Peter Pan?</i>

780
01:09:37,846 --> 01:09:40,975
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter...

781
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:45,479
Sersi is Wendy, you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons...

782
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:49,108
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

783
01:09:49,567 --> 01:09:51,068
What's your point?

784
01:09:51,527 --> 01:09:54,071
Tinker Bell's always been in love with Peter.

785
01:09:57,491 --> 01:10:00,703
And it's hard for her
'cause she can never be with him.

786
01:10:03,622 --> 01:10:05,124
I'm sorry, Sprite.

787
01:10:07,042 --> 01:10:08,294
Kingo...

788
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,382
why did Arishem make me this way?

789
01:10:15,467 --> 01:10:16,927
I don't know.

790
01:10:24,518 --> 01:10:25,895
I thought you broke it.

791
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:27,855
Always bring backups.

792
01:10:32,985 --> 01:10:34,778
You have a very angry family, sir.

793
01:10:35,529 --> 01:10:37,406
Yeah, it's a big issue.

794
01:10:37,573 --> 01:10:40,492
<i>What about King Midas?
Everything he touched turned to gold.</i>

795
01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:41,660
<i>-Was that you?
</i>-Dane.

796
01:10:41,827 --> 01:10:43,746
<i>-Confucius? Aristotle?
</i>-Call your uncle.

797
01:10:43,913 --> 01:10:45,497
<i>What? My uncle? No.</i>

798
01:10:45,664 --> 01:10:47,833
You've always wanted
to make amends with him, right?

799
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,377
Now is the time. Trust me.

800
01:10:50,544 --> 01:10:52,129
<i>Sersi, you're so weird.</i>

801
01:10:52,296 --> 01:10:53,547
Dane? Dane?

802
01:10:55,966 --> 01:10:57,426
You're breaking up.

803
01:10:57,593 --> 01:10:58,636
You're breaking up?

804
01:11:01,347 --> 01:11:02,973
How did he take the news?

805
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:05,976
Couldn't bring myself to tell him
it was the end of the world.

806
01:11:06,143 --> 01:11:08,395
There's nothing he could do.

807
01:11:08,562 --> 01:11:09,563
Sersi.

808
01:11:12,942 --> 01:11:14,652
I'm worried about you.

809
01:11:15,653 --> 01:11:18,614
If Arishem finds out
you're trying to stop the emergence...

810
01:11:20,574 --> 01:11:23,494
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

811
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,543
I'm not afraid.

812
01:11:31,794 --> 01:11:34,213
This violent cycle has to end.

813
01:11:38,717 --> 01:11:40,553
Hey, stop worrying about me.

814
01:11:41,637 --> 01:11:42,972
Old habit.

815
01:11:50,187 --> 01:11:52,273
Why did you leave?

816
01:11:54,066 --> 01:11:55,192
I told myself...

817
01:11:56,068 --> 01:11:58,070
something must have happened to you.

818
01:11:58,237 --> 01:12:00,239
So, I waited.

819
01:12:00,406 --> 01:12:02,867
Days became years...

820
01:12:03,033 --> 01:12:05,244
and you never came back.

821
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:08,706
Sersi...

822
01:12:09,456 --> 01:12:11,292
I've missed you.

823
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:15,963
I didn't want to leave.

824
01:12:19,049 --> 01:12:20,259
There's something I have to tell...

825
01:12:20,885 --> 01:12:22,094
Ikaris!

826
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:23,929
Ikaris!

827
01:12:33,105 --> 01:12:34,607
Watch out!

828
01:12:34,773 --> 01:12:36,358
Clear the camp!

829
01:12:39,403 --> 01:12:40,738
Get behind me!

830
01:12:40,905 --> 01:12:41,906
One of them took Ikaris.

831
01:12:42,072 --> 01:12:43,240
It's an ambush!

832
01:12:52,666 --> 01:12:54,210
Very nice, sir!

833
01:12:54,543 --> 01:12:56,086
<i>Are you mental? Hide!</i>

834
01:12:56,253 --> 01:12:58,631
We need action sequences.

835
01:12:59,256 --> 01:13:00,466
Sir!

836
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,843
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

837
01:13:05,095 --> 01:13:07,973
How many cameras did you bring, young man?

838
01:13:15,814 --> 01:13:17,233
Kingo!

839
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:18,817
Come on!

840
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:26,742
This way!

841
01:13:26,909 --> 01:13:28,077
Quickly! Come on!

842
01:13:33,207 --> 01:13:34,959
Get in! Get in!

843
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:13,747
Ikaris!

844
01:14:29,346 --> 01:14:33,142
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

845
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,479
No.

846
01:14:39,523 --> 01:14:40,858
Terrible timing, Thena.

847
01:14:41,609 --> 01:14:42,693
Thena!

848
01:14:51,202 --> 01:14:52,453
Stop, Thena!

849
01:15:27,905 --> 01:15:29,031
Let them go.

850
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:30,741
Now is not the time, Sersi.

851
01:15:30,908 --> 01:15:34,078
Please. I know you're better than this.

852
01:15:43,337 --> 01:15:44,463
Druig.

853
01:15:45,673 --> 01:15:47,675
Go! Get to the river!

854
01:16:05,234 --> 01:16:06,652
Gilgamesh.

855
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:09,029
A little help here?

856
01:16:09,196 --> 01:16:10,322
Stay here.

857
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:11,991
Say it.

858
01:16:13,409 --> 01:16:14,410
Stay here.

859
01:16:14,577 --> 01:16:16,662
Good. You're okay.

860
01:16:28,549 --> 01:16:29,884
They're headed for the camp.

861
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:31,760
Go. They need you.

862
01:16:31,927 --> 01:16:33,345
Go, Ikaris.

863
01:16:41,353 --> 01:16:43,480
Sprite, buy me some time!

864
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:54,575
Can you hurry up?

865
01:16:56,702 --> 01:16:57,620
Now!

866
01:17:02,416 --> 01:17:03,459
Dishoom.

867
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,012
Karun! Did you get that?

868
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:16,931
I did, sir!

869
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:53,759
-Kingo!
-Just go.

870
01:17:53,926 --> 01:17:55,386
I'm not leaving you.

871
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:56,762
Sprite!

872
01:18:31,463 --> 01:18:32,464
Ikaris!

873
01:19:15,132 --> 01:19:17,551
Sersi! Are you all right?

874
01:19:28,103 --> 01:19:29,813
How did you do that?

875
01:19:30,648 --> 01:19:32,399
I don't know.

876
01:19:45,538 --> 01:19:47,289
Stop, stop, stop.

877
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,167
Thena.

878
01:20:33,043 --> 01:20:35,337
No. Gilgamesh.

879
01:20:35,838 --> 01:20:37,131
Stay back.

880
01:20:45,389 --> 01:20:46,807
Ajak...

881
01:20:48,434 --> 01:20:49,852
Her memories...

882
01:20:51,937 --> 01:20:53,939
I understand now.

883
01:20:55,065 --> 01:20:57,359
I can see what she saw.

884
01:20:58,611 --> 01:21:00,654
So many planets.

885
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:07,036
So much life destroyed
every time a Celestial is born.

886
01:21:07,745 --> 01:21:09,622
Arishem used us...

887
01:21:09,788 --> 01:21:14,251
and left us to die with each emergence.

888
01:21:14,418 --> 01:21:16,045
We just wanted to survive.

889
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:20,633
And then he sent you.

890
01:21:21,926 --> 01:21:26,096
I will kill you all
for what you have done to my kind.

891
01:21:26,263 --> 01:21:29,058
You are not saviors, Eternals.

892
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,268
You are murderers.

893
01:21:34,939 --> 01:21:35,856
Ikaris!

894
01:21:50,913 --> 01:21:52,289
Thena.

895
01:21:55,292 --> 01:21:56,544
Hey.

896
01:21:58,504 --> 01:22:00,047
Remember.

897
01:22:08,347 --> 01:22:09,807
No.

898
01:22:11,684 --> 01:22:12,977
No.

899
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,898
I'll remember.

900
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:19,608
I'll remember.

901
01:22:42,548 --> 01:22:44,717
I'll remember.

902
01:23:27,134 --> 01:23:28,719
When I left...

903
01:23:28,886 --> 01:23:34,058
I thought about taking over the minds
of every human on this planet.

904
01:23:34,934 --> 01:23:38,270
Violence, fear, greed...

905
01:23:38,437 --> 01:23:39,980
all gone.

906
01:23:40,147 --> 01:23:41,315
Why didn't you?

907
01:23:41,482 --> 01:23:44,068
Because without their flaws...

908
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:46,529
they wouldn't be human.

909
01:23:49,532 --> 01:23:52,535
Please, Druig. You can't stay here anymore.

910
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:56,747
These Deviants are trying to keep us
from killing their own kind.

911
01:23:56,914 --> 01:23:59,750
They have a conscience now.
That makes them more dangerous.

912
01:23:59,917 --> 01:24:01,836
No, Sersi.

913
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,339
That makes them us.

914
01:24:06,048 --> 01:24:08,008
Eternals and Deviants.

915
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:10,845
Arishem's children.

916
01:24:12,012 --> 01:24:15,766
But you are asking me to take control
of a mind of a Celestial.

917
01:24:15,933 --> 01:24:19,186
I do not have that kind of power.

918
01:24:19,353 --> 01:24:21,063
We'll need Phastos.

919
01:24:23,607 --> 01:24:25,025
Well, good luck.

920
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,779
He gave up on humans a long time ago.

921
01:25:01,437 --> 01:25:02,730
I did this.

922
01:25:04,648 --> 01:25:06,984
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

923
01:25:12,406 --> 01:25:14,283
Druig was right.

924
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:17,244
Our mission was a mistake.

925
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:19,455
These people...

926
01:25:21,248 --> 01:25:22,499
they're not worth saving.

927
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:24,502
Oh, Phastos.

928
01:25:24,668 --> 01:25:26,128
They're not worth saving.

929
01:25:38,307 --> 01:25:40,059
-Thanks.
-Give me a good one.

930
01:25:40,226 --> 01:25:41,602
-All right.
-Over here.

931
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:42,686
And...

932
01:25:43,354 --> 01:25:44,396
-Oh, that's great, man!
-Yeah!

933
01:25:44,563 --> 01:25:45,689
-Yeah!
-Oh, yeah!

934
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,525
-Nice.
-Good one. All right, ready? Throw!

935
01:25:48,817 --> 01:25:49,652
So close.

936
01:25:49,818 --> 01:25:50,903
-Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
-Yeah, okay.

937
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:53,030
-Watch this.
-Let me see. Let me see it.

938
01:25:54,198 --> 01:25:55,741
Dad. I'm only a starter.

939
01:25:55,908 --> 01:25:56,909
Hi.

940
01:25:57,076 --> 01:25:58,369
Hello. Can we help you?

941
01:25:58,536 --> 01:25:59,453
Throw it again.

942
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:02,206
Hey, Jack. Ben.

943
01:26:03,415 --> 01:26:06,794
Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.

944
01:26:09,129 --> 01:26:14,176
This is Sylvia and Isaac.
That's Isaac.

945
01:26:14,635 --> 01:26:16,679
-Isaac.
-Dad, that's Superman.

946
01:26:16,846 --> 01:26:19,265
-Dad, that's Superman!
-Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

947
01:26:19,431 --> 01:26:21,392
-No, no! He is Superman.
-That is definitely not Superman.

948
01:26:21,559 --> 01:26:25,479
I saw him on TV.
He was in London, fighting a monster.

949
01:26:26,105 --> 01:26:29,525
And you were with a cape and you were
shooting laser beams out of your eyes.

950
01:26:30,234 --> 01:26:31,235
I don't wear a cape.

951
01:26:31,402 --> 01:26:33,654
-Oh, sorry.
-Okay, well, we should just go inside, right?

952
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:36,323
Can I call you Clark? Is that what you
go by now? Because, you know...

953
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:38,117
You've called me worse.

954
01:26:38,284 --> 01:26:39,827
You got it, Jack?

955
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:41,078
Way to go.

956
01:26:41,245 --> 01:26:43,289
-Yes.
-All right. Show me how it's done.

957
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:46,250
Round and round and round
and round and round.

958
01:26:49,753 --> 01:26:51,463
-Yep, you got it. Keep going.
-Come on.

959
01:27:00,222 --> 01:27:03,184
Yeah. Incredibly natural, guys.

960
01:27:05,936 --> 01:27:08,022
So, after all these years...

961
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,274
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

962
01:27:10,441 --> 01:27:11,942
No need to rub it in.

963
01:27:13,944 --> 01:27:17,990
It all makes sense why she wouldn't let us
interfere with human conflicts.

964
01:27:18,532 --> 01:27:20,201
Conflicts lead to war...

965
01:27:20,367 --> 01:27:24,955
and war actually leads to advancement
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

966
01:27:25,122 --> 01:27:27,124
So our mission was never to...

967
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:30,044
make a peaceful or harmonious world...

968
01:27:30,211 --> 01:27:33,964
but to increase the population at all costs.

969
01:27:34,131 --> 01:27:37,176
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

970
01:27:37,343 --> 01:27:38,344
That's bleak.

971
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:40,012
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child...

972
01:27:40,179 --> 01:27:41,764
that they could be dead within a few days.

973
01:27:41,931 --> 01:27:44,016
Thought you'd given up on humans.

974
01:27:44,767 --> 01:27:46,727
I got lucky. Okay?

975
01:27:48,979 --> 01:27:51,023
I have a family now.

976
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:53,526
They've given me faith again.

977
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:58,697
And I see the good in humanity in them
every single day.

978
01:27:58,864 --> 01:28:00,491
So, look, I cannot help you.

979
01:28:00,658 --> 01:28:01,784
-I am never leaving them.
-Phastos...

980
01:28:01,951 --> 01:28:03,035
I'm sorry, Sersi.

981
01:28:03,202 --> 01:28:04,578
It was wrong for me to use my powers...

982
01:28:04,745 --> 01:28:06,664
without thinking about the consequences
in the first place.

983
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:11,585
So, now, I choose to use my hands
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

984
01:28:12,127 --> 01:28:13,337
Do you?

985
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,589
I don't use my powers anymore.

986
01:28:15,756 --> 01:28:17,091
You sure?

987
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:18,092
What are you...

988
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:25,015
What the hell is wrong with you?
My child is right down the hallway!

989
01:28:25,182 --> 01:28:27,184
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

990
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:29,562
-Oh, my God.
-I bet you've built the perfect safe house.

991
01:28:29,728 --> 01:28:31,272
What is this even made of? Vibranium?

992
01:28:31,438 --> 01:28:32,356
Don't!

993
01:28:36,569 --> 01:28:38,070
Fall collection.

994
01:28:38,237 --> 01:28:39,488
IKEA.

995
01:28:39,655 --> 01:28:40,656
Ass.

996
01:28:40,823 --> 01:28:43,534
How did you even deal with this guy
for over 5,000 years?

997
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:46,287
If you stay here, you might as well
invite the Deviants to dinner.

998
01:28:46,453 --> 01:28:47,997
Never mind waiting for the end of the world.

999
01:28:48,163 --> 01:28:49,415
He has a point.

1000
01:28:49,582 --> 01:28:52,585
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up
in my life and expect me to go with you.

1001
01:28:52,751 --> 01:28:54,753
-I'm not gonna...
-You should go, <i>habibi.</i>

1002
01:28:55,546 --> 01:28:56,839
You want me to go?

1003
01:28:57,006 --> 01:28:59,800
You know what my mom would say to you
right now, right?

1004
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:05,472
He's a chronic procrastinator.

1005
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:07,600
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

1006
01:29:07,766 --> 01:29:09,560
I'm not happy about it...

1007
01:29:10,227 --> 01:29:13,480
but if there's a chance for us to watch Jack
grow up to live a life of his own...

1008
01:29:13,647 --> 01:29:15,357
we should take it.

1009
01:30:43,696 --> 01:30:45,531
The <i>Domo.</i>

1010
01:30:46,699 --> 01:30:48,200
Wow.

1011
01:30:58,043 --> 01:31:01,130
<i>A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.</i>

1012
01:31:01,964 --> 01:31:04,842
<i>An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.</i>

1013
01:31:05,009 --> 01:31:07,595
<i>What are you doing? You know you're
creeping us out. You know that, right?</i>

1014
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:10,681
<i>Oh, God! Stay calm, T, please!</i>

1015
01:31:14,476 --> 01:31:16,854
<i>Chips. It's just chips.</i>

1016
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:21,442
<i>As you can see, being an Eternal does not
preclude you from having human emotions...</i>

1017
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,402
<i>such as cowardice.</i>

1018
01:31:25,905 --> 01:31:27,489
What has she done?

1019
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:31,327
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

1020
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:35,873
This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

1021
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,750
None of us have seen her for centuries.

1022
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,733
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1023
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,151
Excalibur.

1024
01:32:05,694 --> 01:32:07,279
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

1025
01:32:18,374 --> 01:32:21,544
That, and the world is ending.

1026
01:32:26,048 --> 01:32:27,299
Have you seen my movies?

1027
01:32:31,095 --> 01:32:32,096
DVD?

1028
01:32:32,471 --> 01:32:34,014
It's all about streaming now.

1029
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:36,100
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

1030
01:32:36,267 --> 01:32:38,310
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

1031
01:32:38,936 --> 01:32:41,730
You know, I just realized
that if you don't know what an iPad is...

1032
01:32:41,897 --> 01:32:44,024
there's almost no way to explain it.

1033
01:32:48,237 --> 01:32:52,575
So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet...

1034
01:32:52,741 --> 01:32:55,661
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1035
01:32:58,747 --> 01:33:00,124
Did you miss me?

1036
01:33:01,333 --> 01:33:02,877
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

1037
01:33:03,043 --> 01:33:05,129
-Is this new? Because I hate it.
-Are you two...

1038
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:08,257
Phastos, I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1039
01:33:08,424 --> 01:33:09,884
Okay, get ready for it.

1040
01:33:13,179 --> 01:33:14,305
Bracelets?

1041
01:33:14,805 --> 01:33:15,890
You made us bracelets?

1042
01:33:16,056 --> 01:33:17,975
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1043
01:33:18,142 --> 01:33:21,812
Celestials are the most powerful
energy generators in the universe.

1044
01:33:21,979 --> 01:33:25,232
When Arishem made us,
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy...

1045
01:33:25,441 --> 01:33:28,569
to keep our bodies regenerating.
The bracelets, in theory...

1046
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:30,696
shut down our regeneration process.

1047
01:33:30,863 --> 01:33:33,949
And once that happens,
our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.

1048
01:33:34,283 --> 01:33:35,284
What for?

1049
01:33:35,451 --> 01:33:38,245
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy...

1050
01:33:38,787 --> 01:33:42,082
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1051
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:44,752
If I can find a way to connect us all...

1052
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:46,879
one of us could become immensely powerful...

1053
01:33:47,046 --> 01:33:49,757
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest...

1054
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,091
forming...

1055
01:33:54,678 --> 01:33:56,055
a Uni-Mind.

1056
01:33:59,808 --> 01:34:01,769
"Uni" meaning "one," "mind" meaning "mind."

1057
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:02,937
Oh, no, we heard you the first time.

1058
01:34:03,103 --> 01:34:04,396
-Terrible name.
-We'll brainstorm...

1059
01:34:05,064 --> 01:34:06,065
"Brainstorm"!

1060
01:34:06,232 --> 01:34:07,733
-That's a way better name!
-No, I invented it...

1061
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:08,901
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

1062
01:34:14,865 --> 01:34:17,284
We find humans a new home on another planet.

1063
01:34:17,451 --> 01:34:20,287
Are we building a big ship, too?
Take a pair of each animal?

1064
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:22,831
Well, you know what's never saved the planet?
Your sarcasm.

1065
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:24,834
Space colonization could take decades.

1066
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,377
It can happen quickly with our help.

1067
01:34:26,544 --> 01:34:28,963
What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1068
01:34:29,129 --> 01:34:32,883
We could be responsible for billions of lives
not being created across the universe.

1069
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,385
Boss, am I right?

1070
01:34:36,053 --> 01:34:37,805
Say something, Ikaris.

1071
01:34:37,972 --> 01:34:39,640
You don't think we should be doing this.

1072
01:34:46,397 --> 01:34:48,774
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1073
01:34:50,234 --> 01:34:52,111
Sersi should decide.

1074
01:34:54,738 --> 01:34:56,532
Forget who Ajak chose.

1075
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:59,869
You're the strongest.
You should be making this decision.

1076
01:35:00,953 --> 01:35:03,247
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

1077
01:35:03,414 --> 01:35:04,790
Sprite.

1078
01:35:13,924 --> 01:35:15,176
Okay, this is not...

1079
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:16,635
-Ikaris.
-Don't run after him.

1080
01:35:16,802 --> 01:35:18,804
Kingo, I...
You guys.

1081
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:21,682
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1082
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:23,726
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

1083
01:35:23,893 --> 01:35:25,227
I'm okay, Kingo.

1084
01:35:25,394 --> 01:35:27,104
If you think we should do this, I trust you.

1085
01:35:27,271 --> 01:35:29,940
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1086
01:35:31,942 --> 01:35:33,444
What did you say?

1087
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:36,155
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1088
01:35:37,907 --> 01:35:40,784
I'm not who you think I am.

1089
01:36:19,114 --> 01:36:20,741
How long do we have?

1090
01:36:21,158 --> 01:36:22,743
Seven days.

1091
01:36:23,285 --> 01:36:24,578
Good.

1092
01:36:26,163 --> 01:36:28,165
We completed our mission.

1093
01:36:31,001 --> 01:36:32,545
Where is she?

1094
01:36:32,711 --> 01:36:33,712
London.

1095
01:36:34,547 --> 01:36:36,131
She has a good life there.

1096
01:36:36,298 --> 01:36:38,384
I'm sure she's missed you.

1097
01:36:38,551 --> 01:36:41,846
If I'd gone back to her,
I would only have told her the truth.

1098
01:36:43,681 --> 01:36:45,307
She would've suffered...

1099
01:36:45,474 --> 01:36:47,977
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1100
01:36:48,143 --> 01:36:49,311
Ikaris.

1101
01:36:50,354 --> 01:36:52,022
We have to tell them the truth.

1102
01:36:52,189 --> 01:36:53,607
What?

1103
01:36:53,983 --> 01:36:55,526
-Why?
-Because together...

1104
01:36:55,693 --> 01:36:57,778
we might be able to stop the emergence.

1105
01:36:58,529 --> 01:37:00,197
"Stop the emergence"?

1106
01:37:00,364 --> 01:37:01,365
Listen...

1107
01:37:01,532 --> 01:37:03,367
-Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...
-Listen to me, Ikaris.

1108
01:37:03,534 --> 01:37:06,579
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

1109
01:37:06,745 --> 01:37:09,373
And I have never doubted him.

1110
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,208
-Until now.
-Why now?

1111
01:37:12,168 --> 01:37:13,544
Why now?

1112
01:37:18,424 --> 01:37:23,053
Five years ago, Thanos erased
half of the population of the universe.

1113
01:37:24,513 --> 01:37:26,348
Delayed the emergence.

1114
01:37:28,392 --> 01:37:30,352
But the people of this planet...

1115
01:37:30,519 --> 01:37:33,772
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

1116
01:37:34,982 --> 01:37:38,110
You know, after I let you all go...

1117
01:37:38,277 --> 01:37:41,155
I traveled the world, living among them.

1118
01:37:41,322 --> 01:37:44,909
I have seen them fight and lie and kill...

1119
01:37:45,201 --> 01:37:47,536
but I have also seen them...

1120
01:37:47,703 --> 01:37:50,122
laugh and love.

1121
01:37:50,289 --> 01:37:54,293
I've seen them create and dream.

1122
01:37:57,505 --> 01:37:58,881
This planet...

1123
01:37:59,548 --> 01:38:01,133
and these people...

1124
01:38:02,593 --> 01:38:04,261
have changed me.

1125
01:38:05,846 --> 01:38:09,892
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1126
01:38:10,059 --> 01:38:11,685
Not this time.

1127
01:38:13,521 --> 01:38:15,231
I trust you, Ajak.

1128
01:38:19,485 --> 01:38:21,320
I'll follow you to the end...

1129
01:38:22,655 --> 01:38:24,156
as I always have.

1130
01:38:24,323 --> 01:38:25,699
Thank you.

1131
01:38:27,326 --> 01:38:29,286
We have to bring everyone back together.

1132
01:38:31,914 --> 01:38:34,250
There's something I have to show you first.

1133
01:38:44,885 --> 01:38:46,554
It's just up ahead.

1134
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:56,564
They must have been trapped in the ice
for centuries...

1135
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,650
and broke free last week
when the glacier started to melt...

1136
01:38:59,817 --> 01:39:02,528
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1137
01:39:03,737 --> 01:39:06,073
They killed an entire company of oil workers.

1138
01:39:06,866 --> 01:39:08,492
I tracked them here.

1139
01:39:11,996 --> 01:39:14,331
I suspected you might have changed your mind.

1140
01:39:15,499 --> 01:39:17,543
I can't let you betray Arishem.

1141
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:21,338
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

1142
01:39:21,505 --> 01:39:24,508
When the others realize
something is happening to the Earth...

1143
01:39:25,176 --> 01:39:26,343
they'll come to you.

1144
01:39:27,052 --> 01:39:29,930
When they find your body,
they'll know the Deviants are back.

1145
01:39:30,347 --> 01:39:33,017
It'll keep them busy until the emergence.

1146
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:37,062
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

1147
01:39:37,396 --> 01:39:39,857
Kept your secret for centuries...

1148
01:39:40,191 --> 01:39:42,943
lied to everyone I cared about...

1149
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:47,740
but never have I doubted my purpose
to serve the Celestials.

1150
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:50,367
Oh, Ikaris.

1151
01:39:55,247 --> 01:39:58,125
I've led you down the wrong path.

1152
01:39:58,918 --> 01:40:00,336
It's the only path I know.

1153
01:42:54,093 --> 01:42:56,053
Thought I'd find you here.

1154
01:42:56,554 --> 01:42:58,973
I've thought about this place a lot.

1155
01:43:00,182 --> 01:43:02,518
Amazing how things change over time.

1156
01:43:03,102 --> 01:43:05,229
Maybe we're the ones who've changed.

1157
01:43:08,065 --> 01:43:09,942
I know you don't agree with our plan.

1158
01:43:11,068 --> 01:43:14,071
I've always thought of the Celestials
like the ocean.

1159
01:43:15,906 --> 01:43:19,410
They give life
and they take life away without bias.

1160
01:43:19,827 --> 01:43:22,538
If they were gone,
this universe would eventually end.

1161
01:43:23,038 --> 01:43:25,457
What you're trying to do is free humanity
from the natural order.

1162
01:43:25,624 --> 01:43:29,461
It's not natural to allow all life
on an entire planet to be destroyed.

1163
01:43:30,171 --> 01:43:31,922
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

1164
01:43:32,089 --> 01:43:34,049
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1165
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:35,843
It'll all end soon.

1166
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:38,846
Except there is no end, is there?

1167
01:43:39,096 --> 01:43:41,599
We'd carry on without our memories...

1168
01:43:41,765 --> 01:43:43,309
or free will...

1169
01:43:43,475 --> 01:43:45,060
for eternity.

1170
01:43:50,774 --> 01:43:52,151
You're afraid.

1171
01:43:52,568 --> 01:43:55,196
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

1172
01:43:55,905 --> 01:43:57,865
I only wish that when we do...

1173
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:01,702
I would be able to remember you.

1174
01:44:03,787 --> 01:44:06,248
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

1175
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:09,627
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

1176
01:44:15,799 --> 01:44:16,884
Ikaris.

1177
01:44:41,742 --> 01:44:43,035
Sersi?

1178
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:48,499
It's started.

1179
01:44:51,961 --> 01:44:53,629
Oh, no. My God.

1180
01:44:54,213 --> 01:44:55,214
What about the Uni-Mind?

1181
01:44:55,673 --> 01:44:58,425
I haven't figured out a way to connect us,
but I'm close.

1182
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:00,135
-I'm very, very close.
-How much longer?

1183
01:45:00,302 --> 01:45:02,304
I don't know, Sersi!

1184
01:45:05,516 --> 01:45:06,851
Find the point of emergence.

1185
01:45:30,749 --> 01:45:33,335
You always knew the end was coming.

1186
01:45:33,502 --> 01:45:36,130
It must be a relief.

1187
01:45:36,297 --> 01:45:38,299
That Deviant is still tracking us.

1188
01:45:39,008 --> 01:45:41,552
Revenge won't bring peace for you, Thena.

1189
01:45:42,052 --> 01:45:44,263
But killing it might.

1190
01:45:57,359 --> 01:45:58,777
Ikaris?

1191
01:46:00,196 --> 01:46:01,655
What are you doing?

1192
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:10,247
I wanted you to leave this world in peace.

1193
01:46:11,624 --> 01:46:14,043
Without knowing about the emergence.

1194
01:46:14,418 --> 01:46:16,003
But I failed.

1195
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,550
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1196
01:46:28,766 --> 01:46:30,100
I'm close to figuring it out.

1197
01:46:34,605 --> 01:46:35,898
Boss, what are you doing?

1198
01:46:36,065 --> 01:46:37,566
I've let this go on long enough.

1199
01:46:37,733 --> 01:46:38,651
Don't hurt him!

1200
01:46:40,778 --> 01:46:42,363
He lied to us.

1201
01:46:43,239 --> 01:46:44,990
He already knew about the emergence.

1202
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:47,034
No, he didn't.

1203
01:46:47,201 --> 01:46:49,912
Ajak told me everything when we left Babylon.

1204
01:46:51,288 --> 01:46:52,289
What?

1205
01:46:53,290 --> 01:46:55,668
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1206
01:46:55,835 --> 01:46:56,836
No.

1207
01:46:58,128 --> 01:47:00,798
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1208
01:47:00,965 --> 01:47:04,260
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,
why did she choose me?

1209
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,641
What have you done?

1210
01:47:11,976 --> 01:47:13,602
He killed her.

1211
01:47:16,355 --> 01:47:17,356
I had to.

1212
01:47:18,774 --> 01:47:20,651
She loved you.

1213
01:47:23,445 --> 01:47:25,114
-Did she?
-She loved you.

1214
01:47:27,491 --> 01:47:29,827
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

1215
01:47:30,828 --> 01:47:32,830
To know that one day all this would end?

1216
01:47:34,957 --> 01:47:37,334
To keep on lying to you?

1217
01:47:38,794 --> 01:47:40,880
If we gave humanity the choice...

1218
01:47:41,046 --> 01:47:46,135
how many of them would be willing to die
so that billions more could be born?

1219
01:47:46,302 --> 01:47:48,679
We're not giving them a choice.

1220
01:47:49,471 --> 01:47:52,808
Is this why you're willing to kill?

1221
01:47:53,809 --> 01:47:56,478
You are so pathetic!

1222
01:47:56,896 --> 01:47:59,190
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1223
01:47:59,815 --> 01:48:02,860
I exist for Arishem.

1224
01:48:03,027 --> 01:48:04,278
As do you.

1225
01:48:04,778 --> 01:48:05,779
It's who you are.

1226
01:48:05,946 --> 01:48:10,618
I wouldn't change a single thing
about who I am.

1227
01:48:10,784 --> 01:48:12,745
Born or made.

1228
01:48:12,912 --> 01:48:15,164
But I do not exist for Arishem...

1229
01:48:15,331 --> 01:48:17,291
I exist for my family!

1230
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:19,919
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1231
01:48:22,963 --> 01:48:24,173
-No!
-Makkari!

1232
01:48:26,509 --> 01:48:27,968
Get out of here!

1233
01:48:31,013 --> 01:48:32,389
Kingo.

1234
01:48:40,314 --> 01:48:42,900
You do not turn against your family.

1235
01:48:43,817 --> 01:48:46,195
Gilgamesh died because of you.

1236
01:48:48,113 --> 01:48:49,573
You won't succeed against me.

1237
01:48:50,574 --> 01:48:53,160
And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.

1238
01:49:00,918 --> 01:49:02,044
Wait.

1239
01:49:03,003 --> 01:49:04,046
I'm going with you.

1240
01:49:04,213 --> 01:49:05,256
Sprite...

1241
01:49:07,049 --> 01:49:08,092
What is this?

1242
01:49:25,609 --> 01:49:27,444
Because she loves him.

1243
01:49:29,238 --> 01:49:31,699
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

1244
01:49:32,867 --> 01:49:35,035
He really fooled us, didn't he?

1245
01:49:35,911 --> 01:49:37,204
Karun, let's go.

1246
01:49:37,746 --> 01:49:38,956
Wait, where the hell are you going?

1247
01:49:39,123 --> 01:49:41,041
I can't help you guys.

1248
01:49:42,084 --> 01:49:43,711
I still think Ikaris is right.

1249
01:49:43,878 --> 01:49:46,922
So, that's it, huh? Just gonna follow him?

1250
01:49:47,715 --> 01:49:49,717
I love the people of this planet.

1251
01:49:50,176 --> 01:49:52,469
But if you stop this emergence...

1252
01:49:52,636 --> 01:49:55,014
you are preventing
so many other worlds like this one...

1253
01:49:55,181 --> 01:49:56,765
from being created.

1254
01:49:57,474 --> 01:49:59,310
I still have faith in Arishem.

1255
01:49:59,768 --> 01:50:02,938
But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

1256
01:50:08,903 --> 01:50:11,488
Even with my help, we're no match.

1257
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:13,908
It's Ikaris.

1258
01:50:17,286 --> 01:50:18,287
But...

1259
01:50:19,079 --> 01:50:20,956
I hope to see you on the next planet.

1260
01:50:48,609 --> 01:50:49,610
Look...

1261
01:50:50,319 --> 01:50:53,322
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris...

1262
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:55,991
we'll need to have a backup plan.

1263
01:50:56,158 --> 01:50:57,868
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified...

1264
01:50:58,035 --> 01:50:59,411
are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...

1265
01:50:59,578 --> 01:51:02,122
Well, Sersi did turn a Deviant into a tree.

1266
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:04,250
I'm sorry, what?

1267
01:51:04,917 --> 01:51:06,377
You didn't wanna tell me that?

1268
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,839
I don't know how it happened, okay?

1269
01:51:10,005 --> 01:51:12,424
And I'm pretty sure I couldn't do it again.

1270
01:51:12,591 --> 01:51:15,135
Well, now is the time to try,
don't you think?

1271
01:51:15,302 --> 01:51:17,263
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1272
01:51:17,429 --> 01:51:20,641
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.

1273
01:51:20,808 --> 01:51:22,184
I can't kill a Celestial.

1274
01:51:22,351 --> 01:51:23,978
Sersi. Sersi.

1275
01:51:24,144 --> 01:51:25,521
We can't!

1276
01:51:31,485 --> 01:51:32,611
We can't.

1277
01:51:32,778 --> 01:51:34,321
It's okay, Sersi.

1278
01:51:35,656 --> 01:51:37,032
I got this.

1279
01:51:53,257 --> 01:51:54,884
There's no time for that.

1280
01:51:56,051 --> 01:51:58,762
I didn't see the lies right in front of me.

1281
01:52:00,055 --> 01:52:02,933
I'm not even sure why Ajak chose me to lead.

1282
01:52:04,476 --> 01:52:06,020
I asked Gilgamesh once...

1283
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:08,856
why he chose to protect me.

1284
01:52:09,273 --> 01:52:10,691
He said...

1285
01:52:11,150 --> 01:52:14,486
"When you love something, you protect it.

1286
01:52:15,196 --> 01:52:19,825
"It is the most natural thing in the world."

1287
01:52:22,494 --> 01:52:27,041
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1288
01:52:28,459 --> 01:52:33,881
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1289
01:52:36,383 --> 01:52:37,676
Sersi.

1290
01:52:39,929 --> 01:52:41,263
Get up.

1291
01:52:49,188 --> 01:52:51,649
Ajak chose you for a reason.

1292
01:52:56,904 --> 01:52:57,863
Sersi!

1293
01:52:58,322 --> 01:52:59,365
Sersi!

1294
01:52:59,532 --> 01:53:01,116
Sersi. We need you!

1295
01:53:01,283 --> 01:53:02,826
I already gave that speech.

1296
01:53:02,993 --> 01:53:04,036
What?

1297
01:53:04,203 --> 01:53:05,454
You did... What...

1298
01:53:05,621 --> 01:53:08,624
Sersi, the sphere inside of you...

1299
01:53:08,791 --> 01:53:10,334
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1300
01:53:10,501 --> 01:53:13,629
Maybe I can repurpose it...

1301
01:53:13,796 --> 01:53:16,048
and create a connection between...

1302
01:53:16,549 --> 01:53:17,550
well, all of us.

1303
01:53:18,008 --> 01:53:20,302
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

1304
01:53:20,469 --> 01:53:22,137
-Great.
-Yeah.

1305
01:53:22,847 --> 01:53:24,098
But...

1306
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:26,976
I have to take it out of you.

1307
01:53:29,895 --> 01:53:31,105
Okay.

1308
01:53:32,606 --> 01:53:33,691
Do it.

1309
01:53:35,317 --> 01:53:36,443
Okay.

1310
01:53:44,451 --> 01:53:46,036
Don't kill her.

1311
01:53:46,203 --> 01:53:47,413
Thena...

1312
01:53:48,664 --> 01:53:49,707
Do it.

1313
01:54:03,387 --> 01:54:04,680
Will it work?

1314
01:54:09,393 --> 01:54:10,811
It has to.

1315
01:55:02,613 --> 01:55:04,406
I'm glad you're here.

1316
01:55:08,619 --> 01:55:10,204
Thank you, Sprite.

1317
01:55:25,052 --> 01:55:26,720
Protect the emergence.

1318
01:55:26,887 --> 01:55:28,639
You're really gonna kill them?

1319
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:38,023
Where's Druig?

1320
01:55:38,566 --> 01:55:39,775
He's busy.

1321
01:55:39,942 --> 01:55:42,027
Thena, play nice.

1322
01:55:45,823 --> 01:55:47,241
You've never had to fight me.

1323
01:55:47,408 --> 01:55:48,534
But I've always wanted to.

1324
01:55:56,959 --> 01:55:59,170
It's time to put a god to sleep.

1325
01:57:06,612 --> 01:57:08,447
I should've done this five centuries ago.

1326
01:57:55,786 --> 01:57:57,288
Druig's gone.

1327
01:57:58,205 --> 01:57:59,582
It's over.

1328
01:59:07,107 --> 01:59:07,942
Phastos.

1329
01:59:12,363 --> 01:59:14,156
I have to try and stop this.

1330
01:59:14,323 --> 01:59:16,075
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

1331
01:59:16,242 --> 01:59:18,035
-Keep Ikaris busy.
-We've got you.

1332
01:59:18,202 --> 01:59:19,203
Go.

1333
01:59:28,045 --> 01:59:28,963
Enough.

1334
01:59:59,159 --> 02:00:00,411
Thena, stop!

1335
02:00:32,526 --> 02:00:33,903
Why are you helping Ikaris?

1336
02:00:34,778 --> 02:00:36,155
We can't let it absorb our powers.

1337
02:00:37,489 --> 02:00:38,616
Too late.

1338
02:00:40,284 --> 02:00:42,912
Thena, he's trying to goad you. Don't...

1339
02:00:58,802 --> 02:00:59,803
Makkari!

1340
02:01:08,979 --> 02:01:10,189
Where's Sersi?

1341
02:01:10,564 --> 02:01:12,733
You always did underestimate her.

1342
02:01:14,193 --> 02:01:15,444
Oh, no.

1343
02:01:16,278 --> 02:01:17,905
Not so fast.

1344
02:01:22,368 --> 02:01:23,744
Boss.

1345
02:01:27,915 --> 02:01:30,793
I don't know about you,
but this is really satisfying, right?

1346
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:33,295
Let me go, Phastos! I can't let her do this!

1347
02:01:33,462 --> 02:01:34,755
I don't think so.

1348
02:01:35,172 --> 02:01:38,634
I've been wanting to clip your wings
for a long time, Ikaris!

1349
02:01:51,939 --> 02:01:52,940
Thena.

1350
02:01:55,651 --> 02:01:58,571
Oh, you've changed.

1351
02:01:59,947 --> 02:02:01,574
You're broken.

1352
02:02:02,408 --> 02:02:03,909
Damaged.

1353
02:02:04,493 --> 02:02:06,328
Useless.

1354
02:02:08,581 --> 02:02:12,418
You can't protect any of them.

1355
02:02:26,348 --> 02:02:27,725
Sersi.

1356
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:35,399
You're not powerful enough to do this.

1357
02:02:35,566 --> 02:02:37,484
And you won't.

1358
02:02:37,902 --> 02:02:39,653
You're not a killer.

1359
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:41,405
Maybe I've changed.

1360
02:02:41,864 --> 02:02:44,366
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

1361
02:02:44,533 --> 02:02:47,161
Are you really willing
to let everyone on this planet die?

1362
02:02:55,961 --> 02:02:57,755
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1363
02:03:10,226 --> 02:03:12,436
I've always envied you, Sersi.

1364
02:03:14,522 --> 02:03:16,565
'Cause you get to live as one of them.

1365
02:03:17,107 --> 02:03:18,192
And I never could.

1366
02:03:19,443 --> 02:03:21,695
You know why I hated living with humans?

1367
02:03:22,279 --> 02:03:25,074
Because they reminded me of
things I didn't even know I wanted.

1368
02:03:25,574 --> 02:03:28,953
Because of them, now I wanna know
what it feels like to grow up.

1369
02:03:30,079 --> 02:03:31,789
To fall in love.

1370
02:03:32,581 --> 02:03:34,208
To have a family.

1371
02:03:35,501 --> 02:03:39,171
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

1372
02:03:46,303 --> 02:03:47,429
It's all over now.

1373
02:03:48,264 --> 02:03:50,599
We get to start over somewhere new.

1374
02:03:54,520 --> 02:03:56,146
Well, that was very moving.

1375
02:03:56,313 --> 02:03:57,565
Druig.

1376
02:04:03,279 --> 02:04:04,822
I can't do this.

1377
02:04:08,492 --> 02:04:10,369
This is your fight now.

1378
02:04:54,955 --> 02:04:56,165
Thena.

1379
02:04:57,541 --> 02:04:58,792
It's me.

1380
02:04:59,376 --> 02:05:00,544
Gilgamesh.

1381
02:05:01,962 --> 02:05:03,005
Look at me.

1382
02:05:04,048 --> 02:05:05,341
Gilgamesh?

1383
02:05:05,508 --> 02:05:07,051
Stay here.

1384
02:05:09,762 --> 02:05:11,013
Say it.

1385
02:05:11,555 --> 02:05:13,224
Stay here.

1386
02:05:14,099 --> 02:05:15,809
You'll be okay.

1387
02:05:17,853 --> 02:05:19,688
Give me your hand.

1388
02:05:32,993 --> 02:05:34,203
It's a shame.

1389
02:05:36,247 --> 02:05:37,873
You and I...

1390
02:05:38,457 --> 02:05:40,376
we're just tools of a god.

1391
02:05:41,752 --> 02:05:44,964
Built to kill.

1392
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,051
Thena.

1393
02:05:52,513 --> 02:05:53,889
Remember.

1394
02:06:24,378 --> 02:06:25,963
I remember.

1395
02:07:55,261 --> 02:07:56,720
Come on, Sersi.

1396
02:07:57,763 --> 02:07:58,848
Come on.

1397
02:10:08,018 --> 02:10:09,770
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1398
02:12:38,919 --> 02:12:40,462
I'm sorry.

1399
02:12:42,173 --> 02:12:43,632
I know.

1400
02:13:59,208 --> 02:14:00,251
How?

1401
02:14:00,709 --> 02:14:02,086
How did you do it?

1402
02:14:03,212 --> 02:14:06,465
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

1403
02:14:06,882 --> 02:14:09,260
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

1404
02:14:09,426 --> 02:14:10,761
I always wondered how we survived...

1405
02:14:10,928 --> 02:14:13,597
the destruction of other planets
that we were on.

1406
02:14:13,973 --> 02:14:16,475
By being connected to the Celestial
as it emerged.

1407
02:15:20,206 --> 02:15:21,415
Is he gone?

1408
02:15:31,091 --> 02:15:32,343
Sprite.

1409
02:15:34,845 --> 02:15:37,431
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

1410
02:15:38,390 --> 02:15:40,559
I think I can make you human.

1411
02:15:41,936 --> 02:15:44,855
All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.

1412
02:15:45,022 --> 02:15:47,900
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

1413
02:15:48,067 --> 02:15:49,109
Are you ready for that?

1414
02:15:51,529 --> 02:15:52,947
I am.

1415
02:16:30,359 --> 02:16:32,486
{\an8}<i>The sudden appearance of an enormous
stone figure in the Indian Ocean...</i>

1416
02:16:34,154 --> 02:16:36,949
{\an8}<i>...has left more questions than answers
for authorities.</i>

1417
02:16:37,825 --> 02:16:41,327
<i>U.S. and Australian naval ships
are maintaining defensive positions...</i>

1418
02:16:41,495 --> 02:16:42,495
<i>but at this...</i>

1419
02:16:42,663 --> 02:16:44,540
You guys did that?

1420
02:16:45,332 --> 02:16:47,626
I love you so much.

1421
02:16:54,924 --> 02:16:56,302
Are you okay?

1422
02:16:57,218 --> 02:16:59,221
I get confused sometimes.

1423
02:16:59,388 --> 02:17:01,432
Yeah. Me, too.

1424
02:17:04,018 --> 02:17:06,312
So, Dad said you're the goddess Athena.

1425
02:17:06,477 --> 02:17:08,564
"Thena." Drop the "A."

1426
02:17:11,483 --> 02:17:13,318
What's your superpower?

1427
02:17:17,198 --> 02:17:19,450
Can you just... Look... One second.

1428
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,826
Okay. All right.

1429
02:17:22,369 --> 02:17:24,079
See, that thing is... Okay.

1430
02:17:24,245 --> 02:17:25,748
Almost gave you a shave and a haircut,
didn't she?

1431
02:17:25,915 --> 02:17:27,374
Stand behind me, actually.

1432
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:29,502
You remember earmuffs?
Remember how we practiced earmuffs?

1433
02:17:29,668 --> 02:17:31,378
Thank you so much.

1434
02:17:33,547 --> 02:17:36,258
You know that your babysitting privileges
are completely revoked, right?

1435
02:17:36,424 --> 02:17:37,468
Like, it's done.

1436
02:17:37,968 --> 02:17:39,844
Thank you. Violence... Hey.

1437
02:17:40,012 --> 02:17:42,848
Violence is never the answer.
Right, T?

1438
02:17:43,014 --> 02:17:45,643
You gotta always use your brain.

1439
02:17:45,808 --> 02:17:47,520
Like you did fighting on the beach?

1440
02:17:47,686 --> 02:17:48,938
Your dad...

1441
02:17:49,103 --> 02:17:51,482
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy...

1442
02:17:51,648 --> 02:17:53,150
and he had no choice but to listen to me,
so no violence.

1443
02:17:57,237 --> 02:17:58,739
When are you guys leaving?
When is that happening?

1444
02:17:58,906 --> 02:18:00,782
That's happening soon, right?

1445
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:03,786
Yes, there's Druig.
Don't go anywhere near him.

1446
02:18:04,327 --> 02:18:05,454
Yeah!

1447
02:18:07,873 --> 02:18:09,208
Okay, that's far enough, Jack.

1448
02:18:09,375 --> 02:18:11,709
Wow, Dad, the <i>Domo</i>'s so cool.

1449
02:18:11,877 --> 02:18:13,504
Your dad fixed that with his bare hands.

1450
02:18:13,671 --> 02:18:15,255
Can we go to space, too, one day?

1451
02:18:15,422 --> 02:18:17,924
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

1452
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:20,218
Hey, Phastos.

1453
02:18:21,053 --> 02:18:22,429
Take care.

1454
02:18:22,805 --> 02:18:24,389
This world is lucky to have you.

1455
02:18:25,224 --> 02:18:26,851
Thank you.

1456
02:18:27,017 --> 02:18:28,686
I know you're not a hugger, so...

1457
02:18:31,856 --> 02:18:32,940
Okay.

1458
02:18:35,901 --> 02:18:39,989
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there...

1459
02:18:40,155 --> 02:18:43,157
that they'll accept the truth the way we did?

1460
02:19:01,050 --> 02:19:02,761
Told you that thing was addictive.

1461
02:19:03,929 --> 02:19:04,972
Please visit?

1462
02:19:05,598 --> 02:19:06,807
I'll try.

1463
02:19:07,391 --> 02:19:08,726
When I get time off from school.

1464
02:19:08,893 --> 02:19:11,562
Oh, wow. Listen, it's gonna be good for you
to be in a human environment.

1465
02:19:11,728 --> 02:19:13,522
You'll pick up some social skills.

1466
02:19:14,064 --> 02:19:15,441
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

1467
02:19:16,816 --> 02:19:18,818
That explains so much.

1468
02:19:28,537 --> 02:19:30,080
Gonna miss you.

1469
02:19:30,623 --> 02:19:31,832
Me, too.

1470
02:19:35,503 --> 02:19:36,629
Madam.

1471
02:19:37,087 --> 02:19:38,379
Thanks, Karun.

1472
02:19:38,964 --> 02:19:41,424
Sometimes I wonder if we did the right thing.

1473
02:19:43,052 --> 02:19:44,136
Killing Tiamut.

1474
02:19:44,303 --> 02:19:46,055
It's too late for that.

1475
02:19:46,222 --> 02:19:48,182
But you followed your heart.

1476
02:19:48,349 --> 02:19:49,808
We all did.

1477
02:19:52,019 --> 02:19:53,020
Even Ikaris.

1478
02:20:00,611 --> 02:20:02,571
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

1479
02:20:03,739 --> 02:20:05,866
He's a lot cuter in person.

1480
02:20:08,285 --> 02:20:11,497
So, after all that,
you still can't change me into a giraffe?

1481
02:20:12,164 --> 02:20:15,835
Well, I could next time
I'm connected to a Celestial...

1482
02:20:16,001 --> 02:20:18,212
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

1483
02:20:18,379 --> 02:20:21,173
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

1484
02:20:25,135 --> 02:20:26,554
What'll you do now?

1485
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:28,013
Not sure.

1486
02:20:28,180 --> 02:20:30,182
This planet's my home, but...

1487
02:20:31,934 --> 02:20:34,645
I can't pretend to be human anymore.

1488
02:20:41,235 --> 02:20:42,820
I love you, Sersi.

1489
02:20:44,363 --> 02:20:45,447
I don't care what you are.

1490
02:20:59,253 --> 02:21:01,881
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

1491
02:21:02,047 --> 02:21:05,050
I have no more secrets, I promise.

1492
02:21:05,217 --> 02:21:06,719
Actually...

1493
02:21:06,886 --> 02:21:09,180
I have one I want to tell you.

1494
02:21:10,264 --> 02:21:11,807
What is it?

1495
02:21:13,767 --> 02:21:16,270
It turns out my family history is...

1496
02:21:17,188 --> 02:21:18,772
complicated.

1497
02:21:22,193 --> 02:21:23,569
Sersi?

1498
02:21:24,361 --> 02:21:25,863
Sersi, what's wrong?

1499
02:21:27,323 --> 02:21:28,657
Sersi?

1500
02:21:52,473 --> 02:21:53,849
Sersi?

1501
02:21:54,725 --> 02:21:55,976
Sersi?

1502
02:21:56,852 --> 02:21:59,021
Sersi!

1503
02:22:13,827 --> 02:22:17,206
You have chosen to sacrifice a Celestial...

1504
02:22:17,581 --> 02:22:20,000
for the people of this planet.

1505
02:22:21,293 --> 02:22:23,087
I will spare them...

1506
02:22:23,254 --> 02:22:27,967
but your memories will show
if they're worthy to live.

1507
02:22:29,468 --> 02:22:33,681
And I will return for judgment.

1508
02:22:49,071 --> 02:22:51,115
You all right, Ted?

1509
02:22:52,825 --> 02:22:54,702
Did you see that?

1510
02:26:04,308 --> 02:26:05,643
Arishem.

1511
02:26:07,895 --> 02:26:09,605
We have to go back.

1512
02:26:22,576 --> 02:26:23,911
What?

1513
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:37,883
Wow.

1514
02:26:38,759 --> 02:26:41,387
My ears. My eyes are numb.

1515
02:26:41,554 --> 02:26:44,390
No more drunk teleporting for you.

1516
02:26:45,724 --> 02:26:46,892
Hang on, hang on.

1517
02:26:52,773 --> 02:26:54,233
Behold...

1518
02:26:54,900 --> 02:26:57,486
the royal prince of Titan...

1519
02:26:57,653 --> 02:27:00,865
brother of Thanos, the Knave of Hearts...

1520
02:27:01,031 --> 02:27:02,116
defeater...

1521
02:27:03,450 --> 02:27:05,411
-...of Black Robert...
-Roger.

1522
02:27:07,329 --> 02:27:09,790
Defeater of Black Roger.

1523
02:27:10,416 --> 02:27:11,709
The great adventurer...

1524
02:27:12,251 --> 02:27:16,172
Starfox of Mystery Planet.

1525
02:27:16,755 --> 02:27:18,966
What a pleasure to make your acquaintance...

1526
02:27:19,508 --> 02:27:21,385
my fellow Eternals.

1527
02:27:22,428 --> 02:27:24,763
You know, you really don't have to
do the whole thing every time.

1528
02:27:24,930 --> 02:27:26,140
Everything you do is impressive.

1529
02:27:26,307 --> 02:27:27,308
-What am I gonna leave off the list?
-No, I know it's impressive.

1530
02:27:27,558 --> 02:27:28,559
Who are you?

1531
02:27:30,811 --> 02:27:31,937
I'm Eros.

1532
02:27:32,438 --> 02:27:33,480
This is Pip.

1533
02:27:33,898 --> 02:27:37,109
And you are as beautiful
as legends say, Thena.

1534
02:27:37,276 --> 02:27:38,569
What do you want, lads?

1535
02:27:38,736 --> 02:27:40,404
Pip and I are here to help,
aren't we?

1536
02:27:45,868 --> 02:27:47,953
Your friends are in big trouble.

1537
02:27:49,622 --> 02:27:51,707
And we know where to find them.

1538
02:34:43,118 --> 02:34:44,578
You can do this.

1539
02:34:45,829 --> 02:34:47,665
You can do this.

1540
02:35:11,939 --> 02:35:13,440
I'm sorry.

1541
02:35:15,651 --> 02:35:17,278
I have to try.

1542
02:35:31,375 --> 02:35:33,961
Sure you're ready for that, Mr. Whitman?

1543
