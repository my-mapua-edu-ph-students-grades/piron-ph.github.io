1
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,355
It is time.

2
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,768
It's beautiful, isn't it?

3
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,437
I'm lkaris.

4
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,773
I'm Sersi.

5
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,228
It's coming! Run!

6
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,108
Father!

7
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,192
Run!

8
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,398
Good fight.

9
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,741
You, too.

10
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,095
Thank you, Ajak.

11
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,992
Shit.

12
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,374
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

13
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,894
I know I'm late, Charlie.

14
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,943
"In this broad Earth of ours,

15
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,446
"Amid the measureless
grossness and the slag,

16
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,825
"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,

17
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,577
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

18
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,331
The poet's hope and optimism in humanity

19
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,917
echoes our recent universal victory,

20
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,961
the return of half our population...

21
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,288
And, thank God,
there she is.

22
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,549
Our brilliant museum scientist,
Ms Sersi,

23
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,925
the person who will be

24
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,094
and was always supposed to be

25
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,595
giving you your presentation today.

26
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,598
Thank you, Mr Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

27
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,600
Today, we'll be learning
about the importance

28
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,645
of apex predators
in a balanced ecosystem.

29
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,981
Poetry?

30
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,542
I completely
ran out of things to say,

31
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,693
and these kids make me nervous.

32
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,070
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

33
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:50,697
See you tonight.

34
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,491
Ooh! "See you tonight."

35
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,243
All right, settle down.

36
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:58,747
So...

37
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,624
who can tell me
what an apex predator is?

38
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,793
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

39
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,128
Very good.

40
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,630
Apex predators do hunt
their prey for food,

41
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,965
like all predators.

42
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,967
But one thing that sets them apart

43
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,720
is that there are no other
animals in their habitat

44
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,764
strong enough to hunt them.

45
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,349
Who can give me an example?

46
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,517
Lions.

47
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,436
- Wolves.
- Correct.

48
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,273
Earthquake.

49
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,696
Get down. Get down!

50
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,530
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

51
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,868
Let me help you.
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

52
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,836
It's all right. Come here.

53
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,965
You're all right.
You're all right.

54
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,468
I like this song.

55
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,761
Me, too.

56
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,139
Do you wanna dance?

57
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,266
Wait, what the hell?

58
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,434
Your hand!

59
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,022
You've had too much to drink.
I gotta go.

60
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:57,574
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

61
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,745
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dane.</i>

62
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,875
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

63
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,960
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

(<i>STAY IN THE GROOVE PT. 1</i>

66
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,635
Is this from the Middle Ages?

67
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,012
It has your family crest.

68
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,472
It must have cost a fortune.

69
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,474
I'm a good eBay bidder.

70
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,559
Thank you.

71
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,519
Happy birthday.

72
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,026
So, have you given any more thought

73
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,777
to us moving in together?

74
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,113
Yeah, I... I thought about it.

75
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,283
I can't move in with you.

76
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,285
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Thought you'd say that.

77
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,494
I'm sorry.

78
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,955
And I think I know why.

79
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,334
Are you a wizard?

80
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,835
What?

81
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,004
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

82
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,088
No. I'm...

83
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,524
I've noticed some unusual things happen

84
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,549
when I'm around you.

85
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,676
Like our water always turns to coffee

86
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,904
whenever the waiter ignores us.

87
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,071
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

88
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,890
- And Sprite says things...
- Mm.

89
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,516
...like you and your ex-boyfriend

90
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,018
broke up a century ago.

91
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,645
She said that?

92
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,021
And he can fly.

93
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,106
He's a pilot.

94
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,235
Get a room, you two.

95
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,779
Can we go now?
It's past my bedtime.

96
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,868
Are you really in love?

97
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,286
What if I am?

98
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,622
You better tell him
the truth, then.

99
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,415
I'm working on it.

100
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,387
You guys wanna get pizza?

101
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,805
No, thank you!

102
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,142
He won't live forever, you know.

103
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,227
Move in with him.

104
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,104
I live with you.

105
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,524
Dane.

106
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,112
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

107
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,905
Dane, run!

108
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,543
- Sersi?
- Let's go.

109
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,630
- What is that thing?
- A Deviant!

110
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,965
You said you killed them all!

111
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,133
You told him that?

112
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,884
- You believed me?
- I do now!

113
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,143
What are you doing?

114
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,352
Keep Dane safe!

115
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,396
Sersi, wait! What?

116
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:42,989
You're fine, dude.

117
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,282
Sprite!

118
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,414
No. Stairs.

119
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,120
Run! Go! Go!

120
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,663
- Go!
- Come on!

121
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,714
It knows where we are!

122
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,965
How?

123
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,093
I don't know!

124
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,053
Sprite!

125
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,143
Sprite!

126
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,414
Ikaris!

127
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,500
Evening, ladies.

128
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,420
Watch out!

129
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,895
Wizard.

130
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,775
Sorry.

131
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,882
Did it just heal itself?

132
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,486
Ikaris.

133
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,156
It's good to see you.

134
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,450
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

135
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,458
I'm Dane.

136
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,043
Hello, Dane.

137
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,754
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

138
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,395
We're Eternals,
from a planet called Olympia.

139
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,066
We came here 7,000 years ago
on the <i>Domo,</i>

140
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,653
our starship, to protect
humans from the Deviants.

141
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,114
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago,

142
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,824
but now they're back.

143
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,346
Look, if you don't
want to move in with me,

144
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,371
you could just say.

145
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,956
Dane, this is serious.

146
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,707
Oh, I know.
I'm just still getting

147
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,151
over the fact you're not a wizard.

148
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,437
I was hoping you could
change me into a giraffe.

149
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,105
I always wanted to be
a giraffe when I was a kid.

150
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,423
It's too bad I can't change
sentient beings.

151
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,191
You would have made a very cute giraffe.

152
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,140
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

153
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,725
Or any war?

154
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,849
Or all the other terrible things
throughout history?

155
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,020
We were instructed

156
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,414
not to interfere in any human conflicts

157
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,624
unless Deviants were involved.

158
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,857
Why?

159
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,820
If we'd protected humanity
from everything

160
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,238
for 7,000 years,

161
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,490
you'd never have had
the chance to develop

162
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,284
in the way you were meant to.

163
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,663
But if the Deviants were
eradicated a long time ago,

164
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,123
why are you still here?

165
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,374
We've been waiting...

166
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,876
to be told we can go home.

167
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,921
So...

168
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,965
lkaris.

169
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,718
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

170
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,554
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

171
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,140
In the fifth century BC?

172
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,850
How long were you two together?

173
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,976
5,000 years.

174
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,896
I guess you can call that long-term.

175
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,399
What happened?

176
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,484
He left.

177
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,238
I always thought he'd come back, but...

178
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,490
he never did.

179
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,451
So, I moved on.

180
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,286
I'm glad you did.

181
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,330
I'm sorry.

182
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,207
I have to go.

183
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,509

184

00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,684
<i>Many have speculated
its connection with the Blip.</i>

188
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,103
<i>The UN has called
for an emergency meeting...</i>

189
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,397
That Deviant healed itself.

190
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,442
They could never do that before.

191
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,363
And it was coming after us
instead of humans.

192
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,614
What's going on?

193
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,492
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

194
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,744
That Deviant is news to me.

195
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,540
Something's happening to Earth.

196
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,627
Can't be a coincidence.

197
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,880
We need to find the others.

198
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,466
I haven't seen
some of them for centuries.

199
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,551
I doubt much has changed.

200
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,564
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

201
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,072
But we need to stick together.

202
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,534
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

203
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,829
Let's go to Ajak first.

204
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,665
She'll know what to do.

205
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,212
You hear that, Sprite?

206
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,881
Family reunion.

207
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,425
It's about time.

208
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,148
Hey, that one was mine!
Oh, never mind.

209
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,450
Do not fear.

210
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,786
Quickly, inside the gate!

211
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,494
Ajak.

212
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,663
Arishem.

213
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,667
We continue to keep Babylon
safe from the Deviants.

214
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,336
More people have come to seek refuge.

215
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,256
It is now the largest city on Earth.

216
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,174
The Eternals serving
their missions

217
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,259
across the galaxies

218
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,135
will learn from your success.

219
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:26,679
Thank you.

220
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,935
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

221
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,731
But I have noticed something
special about this planet.

222
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,153
And I fear that maybe
this time the cost may...

223
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,031
Do not become
attached to this planet.

224
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,035
You must focus on the true purpose
of your mission.

225
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,955
I understand.

226
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,000
I will not let you down.

227
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,817
Phastos.

228
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,862
Did you go to the party
last night like I told you to?

229
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,030
The party, yeah.

230
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,957
- Yeah, it was...
- He worked all night.

231
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,259
Who was talking to you?

232
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,468
Get a life.

233
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,620
- And where is Sersi?
- Late as usual.

234
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,139
I'm sorry,
but I have something

235
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,624
very exciting to show you, okay?

236
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,626
Wait till you see this.

237
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,422
What is it?

238
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,132
It's an engine.

239
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,344
It moves steam from
high pressure to low pressure.

240
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,304
Uh, it'll help them till their fields

241
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,555
at an incredibly fast rate.

242
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,098
It's gonna freak them out.

243
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,101
I mean, they only have had
the wheel 1,000 years, so...

244
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,146
You know, we could do that thing

245
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,315
where you use your mind to control them

246
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,542
and then they could do it quicker.

247
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,817
Ajak, you listening to this?

248
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,820
Phastos, this steam...

249
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,989
- Engine. It's a steam engine.
- It's too soon.

250
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,574
And there she is.

251
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,451
What did I miss?

252
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:16,622
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

253
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,582
I am sure
you have something simpler.

254
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,708
Simple.

255
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,670
Okay, let's see. Uh...

256
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,756
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

257
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,425
the plough.

258
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,387
'Cause that's what it does.

259
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,846
Ploughs dirt.

260
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,348
I met another group of settlers

261
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,517
who are building their homes
in the northern fields.

262
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,081
They'll need to plant
their own crops.

263
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,104
- Thanks, Sersi.
- Listen,

264
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:44,149
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

265
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,152
But there is no telling what wonders

266
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:49,863
they will discover as they advance.

267
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:56,453
The wonders of the world await you.

268
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,666
Follow Gilgamesh and Enkidu into battle.

269
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:05,045
Be forever inspired
by their bravery and strength.

270
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,674
You and your fellow man...

271
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,719
...will go on great adventures.

272
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,972
And become legends of your own!

273
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,121
I just saw that.

274
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,022
There's so many other chairs, man.

275
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,499
You know,
I could use my powers...

276
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,108
Come and have a drink with me.

277
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:27,568
No.

278
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,629
I can't let you go and fight
Deviants on your own.

279
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,822
- We need to guard the city.
- Get out of my way.

280
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,451
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

281
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,371
We need to trust Arishem's design
for this planet.

282
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,750
- Hmm.
- Thena.

283
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,588
It's an honour to fight alongside you.

284
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,466
And you.

285
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,971
My beautiful Makkari.

286
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,222
You're late.

287
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,602
I needed to get
enough artefacts to make a good trade.

288
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,417
Just lie to her.

289
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,325
I can sense vibrations.

290
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,202
Even the tiniest movement.

291
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,956
Including your voices when you speak.

292
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:27,044
Did you two just waste my time?

293
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,089
The Emerald Tablet
you're searching for...

294
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,256
...is a myth!

295
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,365
When humans have conflict,

296
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,819
Ajak tells us not to interfere.

297
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,320
Well, she also says

298
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,031
that stealing is very, very bad.

299
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:00,929
If you don't tell,

300
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,412
I won't tell.

301
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,206
Deal.

302
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,445
I promise I won't
let my feelings for Sersi

303
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,762
distract me from my mission.

304
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,514
Humans are far from being able

305
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,198
to protect themselves from the Deviants.

306
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,184
We still have much to do.

307
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,855
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

308
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,940
I can feel it.

309
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:34,278
But you are allowed
to live a life, you know?

310
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,322
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

311
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,683
Try.

312
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:06,977
Sorry.

313
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,312
I'm making a mess.

314
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,941
Well, not bad.

315
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,812
See you.

316
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,073
Let me help you.

317
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,461
It matches your eyes.

318
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,091
You are very kind.

319
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,150
You're learning
their language now'?

320
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,442
If I want to spend more time with you,

321
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,569
I need to get to know them.

322
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,907
I am very beautiful.

323
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:05,094
Wait, what did I say?

324
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,330
You said, "I am very beautiful."

325
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,501
You...

326
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,006
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

327
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,478
I'm yours, Sersi,

328
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:33,647
if you'll have me.

329
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,235
I love you, lkaris.

330
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,656
I love you, Sersi.

331
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:47,971
May the gods
hereby bond you in matrimony.

332
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,223
Congratulations.

333
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,308
Hello?

334
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,146
Ajak?

335
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,506
Ajak!

336
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,242
It was a Deviant.

337
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,043
<i>Our love.</i>

338
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,547
<i>And our devotion.</i>

339
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:51,219
<i>Were as deep as any ocean.</i>

340
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,226
It was the last time I saw her.

341
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,939
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,

342
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,274
so I went to London.

343
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,195
Turned out, both of us were lonely

344
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,905
and we needed each other.

345
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,742
I guess, in her way,

346
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,912
Ajak never stopped
trying to take care of us.

347
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,796
Bye, Ajak.

348
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,844
It's the first time in 7,000 years

349
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,970
one of us has died.

350
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,057
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London

351
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,017
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

352
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,894
Deviants have never
done that in the past.

353
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,104
It healed itself just like Ajak.

354
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,191
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

355
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,136
- Arishem.
- Sersi.

356
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,930
It is almost time.

357
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,017
Sersi! Sersi!
Are you okay?

358
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,061
What happened, Sersi?

359
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,692
The sphere that Ajak used
to talk with Arishem,

360
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,403
it came out of her body
and went inside me.

361
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,280
Did you talk with Arishem?

362
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,532
Yes. He said

363
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,867
it's almost time.

364
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,829
Can you try talking to him again?

365
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,164
I don't know how.

366
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,208
But she chose you to replace her.

367
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,127
And she gave you the sphere.

368
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,461
Hold on, Sprite.

369
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,528
Are you sure
you talked with Arishem?

370
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:52,966
What else would it be?

371
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,468
Mahd Wy'ry-

372
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,090
Where are the others?

373
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,259
We had to split up.

374
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,511
There were more Deviants
than you said.

375
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,439
Well, I'm sure
that was a lot of fun for you.

376
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,890
It was.

377
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,144
Once the others
kill these last Deviants,

378
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,147
we will have eliminated them
all from the planet.

379
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,208
Don't.

380
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,087
We don't interfere in their wars.

381
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,756
This isn't war.

382
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,716
It's genocide.

383
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,135
Their weapons have become too deadly.

384
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,222
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea

385
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,682
helping them advance, Phastos.

386
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,435
Technology is a part of
their evolutionary process, Druig.

387
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,282
It's not exactly something
that I can stop.

388
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,272
No, you can't.
But I can.

389
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:32,982
Stay strong.

390
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,068
It's too late.

391
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,779
- Thena?
- Everyone is going to die.

392
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,906
Are you okay?

393
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,325
Thena?

394
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,164
- Thena? Thena, no!
- Thena!

395
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,903
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

396
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,865
Listen to my voice.

397
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,243
You are safe.

398
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,955
You are loved.

399
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,625
You're our Thena.

400
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,133
Hey, Thena!

401
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,552
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

402
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,405
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

403
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,824
Sersi.

404
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:05,992
Thena, please.

405
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,620
Come back to us.

406
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,788
Okay.

407
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,723
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

408
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,812
There is no cure...

409
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,147
so no one really talks about it.

410
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,986
What happened?

411
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,196
Thena.

412
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,906
You attacked everyone.

413
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,700
Wounded Sersi, Phastos,

414
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,828
you nearly killed Makkari.

415
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,165
I don't remember.

416
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,417
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

417
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,795
Your mind is fracturing

418
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,755
under the weight of your memories.

419
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:05,176
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

420
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,556
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship

421
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,432
where we have the technology

422
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:12,600
to help you.

423
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,978
But she won't be Thena any more.

424
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,105
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

425
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,773
She could have killed all of us.

426
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,941
Please.

427
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,112
Please, I... I want to remember.

428
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,990
I want to remember my life.

429
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,117
Thena, I love you.

430
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,910
But listen to me.

431
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,664
It's not important
if you remember or not.

432
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,958
Your spirit will remain.

433
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,919
You will always be Thena deep inside.

434
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,379
Trust me.

435
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:42,797
Why should she trust you?

436
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,218
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

437
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,220
Druig, I know you're upset, but...

438
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,430
Upset?

439
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,309
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,

440
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,672
and look where you've gotten us.

441
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,981
I've watched humans
destroy each other

442
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,150
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

443
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,654
Do you know what that does
to someone after centuries?

444
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,033
Could our mission have been a mistake?

445
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,243
Are we really helping these people

446
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,037
build a better world, huh?

447
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,465
We're just like the soldiers down there.

448
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,468
Pawns to their leaders.

449
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,220
Blinded by loyalty.

450
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,975
It ends now.

451
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,702
Let them go.

452
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,412
You're gonna have to make me.

453
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,497
Stop.

454
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,588
If you wanna stop me,

455
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,758
you're gonna have to kill me.

456
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,283
I'll watch over Thena.

457
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,077
Let her keep her memories.

458
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,372
One day, when she attacks you,

459
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,041
you might have to kill her.

460
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,924
We'll take that chance.

461
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,893
You may all go.

462
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,064
The Deviants are gone.

463
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,901
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

464
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,653
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

465
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,613
We're a team,
we should stay together.

466
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,700
I didn't ask you for your advice,
lkaris.

467
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,202
Do not forget your place.

468
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,666
This is where we say goodbye.

469
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,377
You are free to go.

470
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,922
I want you to go out there.

471
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,842
And live a life for yourselves.

472
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,761
Not as soldiers.

473
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,431
Not with the purpose you were given.

474
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,601
Find your own purpose.

475
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:46,647
And one day,
when we see each other again,

476
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,111
I want you to tell me what you found.

477
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:59,619
<i>Come my way
Nach, mera hero.</i>

478
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,038
<i>Get the evil away.</i>

479
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,331
<i>Nach, mera hero.</i>

480
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,625
<i>You came to save.</i>

481
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:07,043
<i>Nach, mera hero.</i>

482
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,378
<i>And now you're here.</i>

483
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,422
<i>Nach, mera hero, oh.</i>

484
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,302
<i>Now you have come home
Give it all to me.</i>

485
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:20,181
<i>You would risk it all
For the victory.</i>

486
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,268
<i>Waiting for you
Scarcely can I</i>

487
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:01,889
Welcome.

488
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,892
I am Karun Patel.

489
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,269
Kingo's valet.

490
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:09,147
It's truly an honour
to be in the presence

491
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,481
of the great Eternals.

492
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,736
<i>Like the fire
Like the sun.</i>

493
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,532
<i>You have risen, Mighty one</i>

494
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,501
Cut! Okay, everyone,

495
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,785
that was good.

496
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,629
But we could do 10% better.

497
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,882
That was beautiful.
Very, very good.

498
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,800
Really, so good.

499
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:40,219
My friends
from college are here.

500
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,762
Hello, boss!

501
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,764
Perfect timing!

502
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,099
Welcome to the set of...

503
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,476
Legend of lkaris.

504
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,346
I'm playing you!

505
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,105
- You like the costume?
- We need to talk.

506
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,749
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

507
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,134
We need to talk to you in private.

508
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,694
Oh, Karun, he's worked
with me for 50 years.

509
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:57,987
I trust him completely.

510
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,573
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire,

511
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,421
and he tried to stake me
through the heart.

512
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,285
I have apologised so many times.

513
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,661
Not quite enough times.

514
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,181
Very close, though.
I'll let you know.

515
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,682
Oh, I have to get ready
for the next scene.

516
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,208
Come to my tent,
we'll talk there.

517
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,685
You guys are gonna love
the next scene.

518
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,629
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

519
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,464
Wait, are we getting back together?

520
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,632
We need to talk.

521
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,984
I've been waiting for the day

522
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:20,152
the world learns the true identity

523
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:21,177
of the Shadow Warrior.

524
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,803
Ajak's dead.

525
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,268
She was killed.

526
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,562
It was a Deviant.

527
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,735
The Deviants are back.

528
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,362
We don't know how many there are.

529
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,825
You need to come with us.

530
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,210
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

531
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,780
We just started shooting this movie.

532
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:05,924
It's the first of a trilogy.

533
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,516
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

534
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,269
Sir,

535
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,686
- may I say something?
- Please don't say anything.

536
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,855
I think you should go.

537
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,263
I just said don't say anything.

538
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:20,653
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

539
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,447
Remember? It's your favourite line

540
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:28,119
from <i>The Shadow Warrior 2:</i>
Voyage of Time.

541
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,705
Your family needs you.

542
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,801
Seven thousand years.

543
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,513
That's how long
the battle between Eternals

544
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,307
<i>and Deviants has raged for.</i>

545
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,934
You think I'm a movie star.

546
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,937
<i>Well, I am.
But I am also...</i>

547
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,440
<i>an Eternal.</i>

548
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,108
<i>Kingo, what are you doing?</i>

549
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:03,195
I think we should be
remembered, so...

550
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,533
I am making a documentary about us.

551
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,661
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

552
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,039
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

553
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,540
Oh, wait.

554
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,921
<i>Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.</i>

555
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,799
This is Sersi.

556
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,384
Sersi,

557
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,386
tell them about yourself.

558
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,556
<i>- Uh...
- We're rolling.</i>

559
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,640
<i>Well, uh...</i>

560
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:37,897
I can change a rock into water.

561
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:41,192
Uh, I could turn a rock into wood.

562
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,444
Or a rock into metal.

563
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,696
Actually, one time,
I turned a rock into air.

564
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,822
Cut.

565
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,325
Um, you know what?
Why don't you think about it,

566
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,035
and we'll get back to you, okay?

567
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,453
Let's go.

568
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,500
Sprite says
you're addicted to this thing.

569
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:00,795
Oh, this?

570
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,172
Look at this.

571
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,425
Whoa.

572
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,135
You know,
seeing as we don't age.

573
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,516
I think you look quite good.

574
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,057
Don't you?

575
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,105
Nobody ever wonders
how you managed

576
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,107
to be the leading man
for over 100 years?

577
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,954
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

578
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,152
That is my great-great-grandfather,

579
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,613
that is my great-grandfather,

580
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,781
grandfather,

581
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,991
father, and me.

582
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,868
I'm part of the greatest dynasty

583
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,161
in the history of Bollywood.

584
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,621
Pretty impressive, right?

585
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,832
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

586
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:43,045
Okay, I got sick
of moving every five years.

587
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:46,173
People freak out
when they notice that you don't...

588
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,260
age.

589
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:51,971
I thought we were friends.

590
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,855
Do you know why I love movies?

591
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,315
Because of you.

592
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,109
I missed sitting in the audience,

593
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,277
listening to your stories,

594
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,695
watching your illusions.

595
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,702
We should've all stayed together.

596
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,789
Ajak would still be alive.

597
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,168
She should have never let us go.

598
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,763
This is the Deviant you fought
in London?

599
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,599
It's different.

600
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,435
There must be more out there
than we thought.

601
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,895
Oh.

602
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,980
Is... Is this a Deviant, sir?

603
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,982
Yep.

604
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,817
It's a beautiful creature.

605
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:50,446
What? This? This?
No. It's hideous.

606
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,240
You've never had one try
to bite your head off. Roll.

607
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,450
Oh.

608
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,928
You're about to meet
two of the greatest warriors

609
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,120
the world has ever known.

610
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,999
<i>Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.</i>

611
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,876
And her trusty friend...

612
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,127
Door.

613
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,880
...a mighty powerhouse of strength,

614
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,925
<i>the fearsome Gilgamesh!</i>

615
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,470
Gilgamesh!

616
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,058
<i>What took you so long?</i>

617
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,063
You look younger today, Sprite.

618
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,707
I have the same apron.

619
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,441
Who the hell are you?

620
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,944
I'm Karun.
Kingo's valet.

621
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:33,197
Oh, valet.
Like Alfred in <i>Batman.</i>

622
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,033
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

623
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,786
No shit.
I could have used some help.

624
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,413
We were attacked
by a Deviant in London, too.

625
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,457
Even lkaris couldn't kill it.

626
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,334
You couldn't?

627
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,503
I was distracted.

628
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,755
Sure, man.

629
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,466
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

630
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,345
I'm sorry, Gil.

631
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,389
Ajak's dead.

632
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,518
It's true, buddy.

633
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,353
We lost her.

634
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,511
Sersi.

635
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,806
The attack triggered her.

636
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,891
She's no fun to be around right now.

637
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,936
Hey, Thena.

638
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,230
Look who's here.

639
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,274
Give me your hand.

640
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,403
Thena.

641
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,239
Everyone in Centuri-6
is going to die.

642
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:58,991
Give me your hand.

643
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,368
It's too late.
We can't save them.

644
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,412
Thena.

645
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,794
Thena.

646
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,214
We came to Earth
together on our ship.

647
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,218
You're an Eternal.

648
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,805
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

649
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,058
The legendary protector of Athens.

650
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,436
The goddess of war.

651
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,774
Remember who you are.

652
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,283
Remember.

653
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,134
- Thena.
- Hi.

654
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,095
Hello.

655
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,430
Hey, who's your gardener?

656
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,142
This is just what you guys
eat every day?

657
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,852
- Yeah, this is amazing.
- Every day.

658
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,105
- Thank you for this.
- Oh, you're welcome.

659
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,439
Help yourself.

660
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,776
This one is a trio of wine,
beer, and mead.

661
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,404
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

662
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,656
That's so thoughtful.

663
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,039
Should she be drinking?

664
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,711
No, hers is
non-alcoholic. For kids.

665
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,965
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

666
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,593
For kids.

667
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,305
I was just kidding.

668
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,767
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you

669
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,894
after we helped defeat
Laufey's army in Tonsberg.

670
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,481
What? Oh.

671
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,607
I'm a big baby.

672
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,651
Very mature. Can you stop?

673
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,928
- Stop.
- Speaking of Odin...

674
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,614
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

675
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,409
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

676
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,911
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone,

677
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,038
who do you think
is gonna lead the Avengers?

678
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,207
I could lead them.

679
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,585
- I figure I'd be good at that.
- Yeah, you would.

680
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,962
Ajak didn't even choose you
to lead us.

681
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,548
- Whoa.
- Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

682
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:20,984
- Harsh.
- I'm gonna let that one slide

683
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,009
because, you know,

684
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,570
you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

685
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,946
Oh, so what,
you can fly.

686
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,680
I'm better-looking,
everybody knows that.

687
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,607
Where you going?

688
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,518
I'm just gonna get some air.

689
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,734
Mmm. This is really good, Gil.

690
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,235
You know, I could sell this.

691
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,112
Put my face on it,
move some units.

692
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,739
I made it from corn.

693
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:47,534
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

694
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,551
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

695
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,678
Yeah, it's a planet.

696
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,223
She thinks she used to live there

697
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,225
until it was destroyed.

698
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:15,020
Always talks about massive
quakes ripping it apart.

699
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,105
Everyone died, including herself.

700
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,192
We had an unprecedented global
earthquake three days ago.

701
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,694
Oh, that's what that was.

702
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,613
I thought I was drunk.

703
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,574
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

704
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,869
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

705
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,913
I've tried so many times.

706
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,208
Maybe you're trying too hard.

707
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,753
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

708
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,302
Sersi.

709
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,262
Arishem.

710
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,723
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

711
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,309
We think it absorbed her power.

712
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,186
And something unusual
is happening to Earth.

713
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,356
It is a side effect
of the emergence.

714
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,401
The emergence?

715
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,653
It is time for you to learn

716
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,323
the true purpose of your mission.

717
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,033
You were sent to Earth

718
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:54,828
to bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

719
00:56:56,038 --> 00:57:00,709
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

720
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,254
I plant Celestial seeds
into host planets

721
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,797
across the universe.

722
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,803
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

723
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,769
<i>In order to grow,</i>

724
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:21,521
<i>Tiamut needs vast amounts of energy</i>

725
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,773
<i>from intelligent life.</i>

726
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:27,277
<i>The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans</i>

727
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,113
<i>until the Eternals eliminated them.</i>

728
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,117
<i>Now, the human population of this planet</i>

729
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:36,662
<i>has reached the required amount.</i>

730
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,873
<i>It is time for the emergence to begin.</i>

731
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,894
But...

732
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,939
everyone on Earth will die.

733
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:08,694
The end of one life, Sersi,

734
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,864
<i>is the beginning of another.</i>

735
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:29,715
<i>Our universe is a constant
exchange of energy.</i>

736
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:34,761
<i>An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.</i>

737
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,931
<i>Celestials use energy</i>

738
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,184
<i>gathered from host planets
to create suns,</i>

739
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:45,063
<i>generating gravity,
heat, and light</i>

740
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,733
<i>for new galaxies to form.</i>

741
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:54,364
<i>Without us,</i>

742
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,701
<i>our universe will fall into darkness.</i>

743
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,330
All life Will die.

744
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,292
Ajak knew the truth?

745
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,753
She has helped many Celestials

746
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:10,589
to emerge over millions of years.

747
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:11,882
So have you.

748
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,095
Earth was my first mission.

749
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:22,309
I was home, on Olympia.

750
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,063
There is no Olympia.

751
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:47,209
This is your true home, Sersi.

752
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,961
The World Forge.

753
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,052
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

754
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:35,006
Everything dies except us

755
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,343
because we were never alive.

756
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,349
Why don't I remember any of this?

757
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,946
Because your memories
are erased and reset

758
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,364
after each emergence.

759
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,033
They are stored here.

760
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,371
Why do you keep them?

761
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,458
I keep them in order
to study the Deviants.

762
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,171
I created the Deviants, Sersi,

763
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,257
for the same purpose I created you.

764
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,179
<i>Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.</i>

765
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:29,019
<i>I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them</i>

766
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,730
<i>so intelligent life could grow.</i>

767
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,946
<i>But there was a flaw in their design.</i>

768
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,490
<i>They evolved.</i>

769
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,701
<i>Became predators themselves.</i>

770
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:48,872
And I lost control of them.

771
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:53,960
I built and programmed you,
Eternals,

772
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,964
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution,

773
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,300
to correct my mistake.

774
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:06,723
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place

775
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,142
as the Prime Eternal.

776
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,478
Do not fail me.

777
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,707
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

778
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:36,169
And our past memories
are stored somewhere

779
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,546
in space?

780
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,091
And Arishem made the Deviants.

781
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,678
I'm sorry, Thena.

782
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,388
You tried to warn us.

783
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,515
The last time
Arishem reset your memories,

784
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,558
something must have gone wrong.

785
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,310
What do you mean?

786
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:55,814
Well, that's what
Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

787
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:57,691
All this time,
Thena was remembering

788
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,484
all the other planets we were sent to

789
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,736
and everyone dying
during the emergence.

790
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,655
I thought we were heroes.

791
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,657
Turns out we're the bad guys.

792
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:08,118
We're not the bad guys, okay?

793
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,619
We've helped the Celestials

794
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:11,162
expand life across the universe.

795
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,499
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

796
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:15,875
Every time innocent lives

797
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,599
have been sacrificed
for the greater good,

798
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,796
it turns out to be a mistake.

799
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,090
We have to stop the emergence.

800
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,885
Sersi, we have no right to
stop the birth of a Celestial.

801
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,846
There has to be a way
Tiamut can emerge

802
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,089
without destroying the Earth.

803
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:33,226
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

804
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,229
Could Druig control its mind?

805
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,648
Maybe put it to sleep?

806
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,941
"Put it to sleep"?

807
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,526
Are you serious?

808
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:44,195
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

809
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,290
So I could take a vacation
to Fiji, you know?

810
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,034
We're talking about a Celestial, okay?

811
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,118
We have to try.

812
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:53,621
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

813
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,123
Right.

814
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:00,170
I'm human.
I'm a little biased.

815
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:01,880
The world is ending.

816
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,506
You need to go home.

817
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:05,842
And do what?

818
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,094
Watch TV?

819
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,765
When I could be with the
Earth's original superheroes

820
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,351
as they try to save the world?

821
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,353
Fine.

822
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,064
If you want to, stay.

823
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,982
Thank you very much, sir.

824
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,902
Gilgamesh,

825
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,755
could you please
get rid of the saliva beer?

826
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,214
I thought you like it, man.

827
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,240
We need to go. Now.

828
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,451
Find the others.

829
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,036
Once we're all together,

830
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,914
we'll decide what to do
about the emergence.

831
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,780
Good afternoon.

832
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,533
It's very nice here, sir.

833
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,992
Don't be fooled.

834
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,204
Ignorance is bliss.

835
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,458
Hey. We're looking for Druig.

836
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,626
Is he here?

837
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:22,752
...Yes.

838
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:23,962
How do you know Druig?

839
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:25,922
We're friends...

840
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,258
...from college.

841
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,388
Hello, Sprite.

842
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,064
I missed all of you.

843
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:49,946
Please, make yourselves at home.

844
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,536
You've given me a lot of bad news

845
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,745
in one go, my lady.

846
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,664
Will you help us?

847
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,207
I am glad that...

848
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,799
Hey, what's your service?

849
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,342
I'm not getting any bars.

850
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:16,389
Do you all remember
this forest? Beautiful.

851
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:19,601
It was the last place
we all lived together.

852
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:24,022
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now

853
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:27,192
from the outside world
and from themselves.

854
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:30,278
Your kind, my friend,
you will be responsible

855
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,071
for your own extinction one day.

856
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,157
Don't you think?

857
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,576
I think we must learn from our mistakes

858
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,785
and do better, sir.

859
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,829
You must not give up hope.

860
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,459
Oh, no, you didn't.

861
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,086
Okay, new rule, no more
possessing people's valets.

862
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,771
Oh, where is
your sense of humour, Kingo?

863
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:49,797
I'm sorry, sir.

864
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:52,175
Don't apologise,
it's not your fault.

865
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,512
You are not a God.
You know that, right?

866
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,806
How ironic.
Kingo, the movie star.

867
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,059
I've directed some things, too.

868
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,602
Oh, yeah? Like what?

869
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,812
Some Internet content.

870
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:06,564
How many views?

871
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,650
I don't do it for the views.

872
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:10,610
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

873
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,071
- We need him.
- Lkaris.

874
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,198
I missed you.

875
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:18,201
Are you gonna charm me
or threaten me?

876
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,411
I mean, there's a third option,
if you prefer that.

877
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,372
It must be heartbreaking to find out

878
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,599
that you're not Mother's favourite.

879
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:24,767
And I'm sure she'd be real proud

880
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,602
- of what you've been up to.
- Druig, this is serious.

881
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,419
I'll tell you what's serious.

882
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,756
I've just been told I've been
sent on a suicide mission

883
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,299
for the past 7,000 years,

884
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:36,803
and that my entire existence is a lie.

885
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,683
So, excuse me for not giving a shit

886
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:43,309
about your plan right now.

887
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,607
Druig sucks.

888
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,109
He does, sir.

889
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,631
I don't like this place.

890
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,359
Druig needs to think,

891
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:17,260
and Sersi wants us to wait, so...

892
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:19,387
- we wait.
- Mm.

893
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:24,350
I couldn't recognise myself
in Sprite's illusions.

894
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,645
Those were the good old days.

895
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,066
What if I can't fight any more?

896
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:35,153
- Of course you can.
- Mm.

897
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,864
What if I hurt you again?

898
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:43,453
Come on. You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

899
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,709
Thank you.

900
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,420
For what?

901
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:57,467
- For always taking care of me.
- Oh.

902
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,553
I'd do it again.

903
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,350
On any planet.

904
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,953
I like watching him, too.

905
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,288
Jeez.

906
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:30,041
I don't think it's creepy at all.

907
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,671
Have you read <i>Peter Pan?</i>

908
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,965
Okay, so, to me, lkaris is Peter,

909
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,342
Sersi is Wendy,

910
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,470
you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons,

911
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,057
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

912
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,017
What's your point?

913
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,020
Tinker Bell's always been
in love with Peter.

914
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,942
And it's hard for her

915
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,652
'cause she can never be with him.

916
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,073
I'm sorry, Sprite.

917
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,243
Kingo...

918
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:10,331
why did Arishem
make me this way?

919
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,876
I don't know.

920
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:22,802
I thought you broke it.

921
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,762
Always bring backups.

922
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,686
You have a very angry family, sir.

923
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,105
Yeah, it's a big issue.

924
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,190
<i>What about King Midas?</i>

925
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:37,543
<i>Everything he touched turned to gold.</i>

926
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,568
<i>- Was that you?</i>
- Dane.

927
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,653
<i>- Confucius? Aristotle?</i>
- Call your uncle.

928
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,405
<i>What? My uncle? No.</i>

929
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,741
You've always wanted to make
amends with him, right?

930
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,285
Now is the time.
Trust me.

931
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:49,179
<i>Sersi, you're so weird.</i>

932
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,622
Dane? Dane?

933
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:54,417
You're breaking up.

934
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:55,626
You're breaking up?

935
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,964
How did he take the news?

936
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,702
Couldn't bring myself to tell him

937
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:02,925
it was the end of the world.

938
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,344
There's nothing he could do.

939
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,512
Sersi.

940
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:11,601
I'm worried about you.

941
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:13,686
If Arishem finds out

942
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,563
you're trying to stop the emergence...

943
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,443
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

944
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,492
I'm not afraid.

945
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,162
This violent cycle has to end.

946
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,502
Hey, stop worrying about me.

947
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:39,921
Old habit.

948
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,180
Why did you leave?

949
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,099
I told myself

950
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,977
something must have happened to you.

951
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:57,146
So, I waited.

952
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,774
Days became years,

953
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,151
and you never came back.

954
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,613
Sersi,

955
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,199
oh, I've missed you.

956
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,870
I didn't want to leave.

957
01:12:15,957 --> 01:12:17,226
There's something
I have to tell...

958
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,001
Lkaris!

959
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:20,837
Ikaris!

960
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,051
Miss?

961
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,428
You're ok?

962
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,472
Watch out!

963
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,891
Clear the camp!

964
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,603
Get behind me!

965
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,914
One of them took lkaris.

966
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:40,106
It's an ambush!

967
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,075
Very nice, sir!

968
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,952
<i>Are you mental? Hide!</i>

969
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,496
We need action sequences.

970
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,331
Sir!

971
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,709
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

972
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:04,839
How many cameras
did you bring, young man?

973
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,056
Kingo!

974
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,641
Come on!

975
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:23,566
This way!

976
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:24,901
Quickly! Come on!

977
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,782
Get in!
Get in!

978
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,529
Lkaris!

979
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:29,924
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

980
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,220
No.

981
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,598
Terrible timing, Thena.

982
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,433
Thena!

983
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:49,193
Stop, Thena!

984
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:24,687
Druig!

985
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,813
Let them go.

986
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,440
Now is not the time, Sersi.

987
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:30,776
Please. I know
you're better than this.

988
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:42,204
Druig. What's happening?

989
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,373
Go! Get to the river!

990
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,309
Gilgamesh.

991
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,686
A little help here?

992
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:06,979
Stay here.

993
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:08,647
Say it.

994
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,067
Stay here.

995
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:13,319
Good. You're okay.

996
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:26,540
They're headed for the camp.

997
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,417
Go. They need you.

998
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,002
Go, lkaris.

999
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,096
Sprite, buy me some time!

1000
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,187
Whoa. Whoa!

1001
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,190
Can you hurry UP?

1002
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,318
Now!

1003
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,074
Dishoom.

1004
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:11,627
Karun! Did you get that?

1005
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:13,546
I did, sir!

1006
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,332
- Kingo!
- Just go.

1007
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,959
I'm not leaving you.

1008
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,335
Sprite!

1009
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:28,996
Ikaris!

1010
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:14,041
Sersi! Are you all right?

1011
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,762
How did you do that?

1012
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,098
I don't know.

1013
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,280
Stop, stop, stop.

1014
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,157
Thena.

1015
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:32,286
No. Gilgamesh.

1016
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,079
Stay back.

1017
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,756
Ajak...

1018
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,759
Her memories...

1019
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,846
I understand now.

1020
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,266
I can see what she saw.

1021
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,561
So many planets.

1022
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:00,647
So much life destroyed

1023
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:03,942
every time a Celestial is born.

1024
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,528
Arishem used us

1025
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:11,158
and left us to die
with each emergence.

1026
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:12,951
We just wanted to survive.

1027
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,539
And then he sent you.

1028
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,501
I will kill you all

1029
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:23,003
for what you have done to my kind.

1030
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,964
You are not saviours, Eternals.

1031
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:28,175
You are murderers.

1032
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:32,805
Ikaris!

1033
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:49,238
Thena.

1034
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,492
Hey.

1035
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:56,995
Remember.

1036
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,755
No.

1037
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:09,925
No.

1038
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,805
I'll remember.

1039
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,515
I'll remember.

1040
01:22:39,538 --> 01:22:41,457
I'll remember.

1041
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,667
When I left,

1042
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:28,712
I thought about taking over the minds

1043
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:31,048
of every human on this planet.

1044
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:35,219
Violence, fear, greed,

1045
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:36,929
all gone.

1046
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,263
Why didn't you?

1047
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:41,016
Because without their flaws,

1048
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,477
they wouldn't be human.

1049
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,483
Please, Druig.
You can't stay here any more.

1050
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:51,860
These Deviants are trying to keep us

1051
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,695
from killing their own kind.

1052
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,614
They have a conscience now.

1053
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:56,841
That makes them more dangerous.

1054
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,784
No, Sersi.

1055
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,287
That makes them us.

1056
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,957
Eternals and Deviants.

1057
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,793
Arishem's children.

1058
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,921
But you are asking me to take control

1059
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:12,714
of a mind of a Celestial.

1060
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:16,134
I do not have that kind of power.

1061
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:18,011
We'll need Phastos.

1062
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:21,974
Well, good luck.

1063
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:25,727
He gave up on humans
a long time ago.

1064
01:24:58,385 --> 01:24:59,678
I did this.

1065
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,932
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

1066
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,231
Druig was right.

1067
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,192
Our mission was a mistake.

1068
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,403
These people...

1069
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,448
they're not worth saving.

1070
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:21,450
Oh, Phastos.

1071
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,076
They're not worth saving.

1072
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,965
- Thanks.
- Give me a good one.

1073
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,508
- All right.
- Over here.

1074
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:39,801
BOY; And...

1075
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:40,987
Oh, that's great, man!

1076
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:42,095
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1077
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:43,305
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice.

1078
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,709
Good one.
All right, ready? Throw!

1079
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:46,683
Oh, so close.

1080
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:47,952
- Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
- Yeah, okay.

1081
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,936
- Watch this.
- Let me see. Let me see it.

1082
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,648
Dad. I'm only a starter.

1083
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:53,815
Hi.

1084
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,360
- Hello. Can we help you?
- Throw it again.

1085
01:25:56,526 --> 01:25:59,613
Hey, Jack. Ben.

1086
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:03,784
Hey, guys.
These are my friends from college.

1087
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:11,124
Uh, this is Sylvia
and, uh, Isaac. That's Isaac.

1088
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,627
- Isaac.
- Dad, that's Superman.

1089
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:14,878
Dad, that's Superman!

1090
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:16,147
Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

1091
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,214
No, no!
He is Superman.

1092
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:18,483
That is definitely not Superman.

1093
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:19,675
I saw him on TV.

1094
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:22,427
He was in London, fighting a monster.

1095
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:24,596
And you were with a cape

1096
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,680
and you were shooting
laser beams out of your eyes.

1097
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,743
- I don't wear a cape.
- Oh, sorry.

1098
01:26:28,767 --> 01:26:30,745
Okay, well, we should
just go inside, right?

1099
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,020
Can I call you Clark?

1100
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:33,414
Is that what you go by now?
Because, you know...

1101
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:35,065
You've called me worse.

1102
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,792
- You got it, Jack?
- Mm-hmm.

1103
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,902
- Way to go.
- Yes.

1104
01:26:38,985 --> 01:26:40,588
All right.
Show me how it's done.

1105
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:43,198
Round and round and round
and round and round.

1106
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:48,742
- Yep, you got it. Keep going.
- Come on.

1107
01:26:57,129 --> 01:27:00,090
- Yeah.
- Incredibly natural, guys.

1108
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,928
So, after all these years,

1109
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,180
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

1110
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,516
- No need to rub it in.
- Mm.

1111
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,228
It all makes sense
why she wouldn't let us interfere

1112
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,896
with human conflicts.

1113
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:17,107
Conflicts lead to war,

1114
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:19,651
and war actually leads to advancement

1115
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:21,862
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

1116
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,114
So our mission was never to

1117
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:27,033
make a peaceful or harmonious world,

1118
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,954
but to increase the population
at all costs.

1119
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:34,124
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

1120
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,292
That's bleak.

1121
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:37,103
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child

1122
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:38,768
that they could be dead
within a few days.

1123
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,964
Thought you'd given up on humans.

1124
01:27:41,715 --> 01:27:43,675
I got lucky. Okay?

1125
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,971
I have a family now.

1126
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:50,474
They give me faith again.

1127
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:53,560
And I see the good
in humanity in them

1128
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,645
every single day.

1129
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,439
So, look, I cannot help you.

1130
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:58,875
- I am never leaving them.
- Phastos...

1131
01:27:58,899 --> 01:27:59,983
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1132
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,590
It was wrong for me to use my powers

1133
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:02,962
without thinking about the consequences

1134
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:03,987
in the first place.

1135
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:06,615
So, now, I choose to use my hands

1136
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,533
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

1137
01:28:09,075 --> 01:28:10,285
Do you?

1138
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:12,568
I don't use my powers any more.

1139
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:13,830
You sure?

1140
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,040
What are you...

1141
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:20,629
What the hell is wrong with you?

1142
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,064
My child is right down the hallway!

1143
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,090
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

1144
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:25,359
- Oh, my God.
- I bet you've built

1145
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:26,468
the perfect safe house.

1146
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:27,719
What is this even made of?

1147
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:28,970
- Vibranium?
- Don't!

1148
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:34,976
Fall collection.

1149
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,394
IKEA.

1150
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:37,562
Ass.

1151
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,290
How did you even
deal with this guy

1152
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,440
for over 5,000 years?

1153
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,067
If you stay here,
you might as well

1154
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,336
invite the Deviants to dinner.

1155
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,080
Never mind waiting
for the end of the world.

1156
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,404
He has a point.

1157
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,198
No, I'm sorry.
You can't just show up

1158
01:28:48,281 --> 01:28:49,717
in my life and expect me to go with you.

1159
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,743
- I'm not gonna...
- You should go, <i>habibi.</i>

1160
01:28:52,536 --> 01:28:53,829
You want me to go?

1161
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,080
You know what my mom

1162
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:56,832
would say to you right now,
right?

1163
01:28:56,957 --> 01:29:00,961
Quit procrastinating, Phil,
and take care of your business.

1164
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,563
He's a chronic procrastinator.

1165
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,548
I'm not leaving you two.
No way.

1166
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:06,508
I'm not happy about it,

1167
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:09,010
but if there's a chance for us to watch

1168
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,571
Jack grow up to live a life of his own,

1169
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,305
we should take it.

1170
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:21,815
<i>Why does my heart
Go on beating?</i>

1171
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:31,241
<i>Why do these eyes of mine cry?</i>

1172
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:39,416
<i>Don't they know
It's the end of the world?</i>

1173
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:45,881
<i>It ended when you said goodbye.</i>

1174
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:51,052
<i>Why does my heart
Go on beating?</i>

1175
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:57,726
<i>Why do these eyes of mine cry?</i>

1176
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:07,444
<i>Don't they know
It's the end of the world?</i>

1177
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:14,367
<i>It ended when you said goodbye.</i>

1178
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,395
The <i>Domo.</i>

1179
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:45,065
Wow.

1180
01:30:54,908 --> 01:30:57,994
<i>A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.</i>

1181
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:01,706
<i>An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.</i>

1182
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:02,874
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1183
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:04,560
<i>You know you're creeping us out.
You know that, right?</i>

1184
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:05,686
<i>Oh! Oh, God!</i>

1185
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,504
<i>Stay calm, T, please!</i>

1186
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:13,677
<i>Chips. It's just chips.</i>

1187
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:15,679
<i>As you can see,
being an Eternal</i>

1188
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:18,264
<i>does not preclude you
from having human emotions</i>

1189
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:20,225
<i>such as cowardice.</i>

1190
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,312
What has she done?

1191
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:28,149
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

1192
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:32,696
This is Makkari.
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

1193
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,572
None of us have seen her
for centuries.

1194
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:38,535
Ready to go home?

1195
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:40,704
Hmm.

1196
01:31:58,471 --> 01:31:59,514
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1197
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:00,932
Excalibur.

1198
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:04,227
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

1199
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,022
So you mean...

1200
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:11,401
I've been waiting for centuries
to go back to Olympia,

1201
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,194
and now you're telling me...

1202
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:15,113
...it doesn't exist?

1203
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,866
That, and the world is ending.

1204
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,327
At last my boredom is ending.

1205
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:24,289
Have you seen my movies?

1206
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:27,709
I don't have a DVD player.

1207
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,044
DVD?

1208
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:30,962
It's all about streaming now.

1209
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:33,048
You know, what you need is a Kindle.

1210
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:35,258
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

1211
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,093
You know, I just realised

1212
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:38,737
that if you don't know what an iPad is,

1213
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,972
there's almost no way
to explain it.

1214
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:49,522
So, how did you end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet,

1215
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:52,609
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1216
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,072
<i>Miss me?</i>

1217
01:32:58,281 --> 01:32:59,967
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this...

1218
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,052
- Is this new?
- Are you two...

1219
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,077
Because I hate it.

1220
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,328
Phastos,

1221
01:33:03,411 --> 01:33:05,205
I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1222
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:06,831
Okay, get ready for it.

1223
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,211
Bracelets?

1224
01:33:11,711 --> 01:33:12,796
You made us bracelets?

1225
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:14,881
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1226
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:16,966
Celestials are the most powerful

1227
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,718
energy generators in the universe.

1228
01:33:18,885 --> 01:33:20,261
When Arishem made us,

1229
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:22,138
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy

1230
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:23,848
to keep our bodies regenerating.

1231
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:25,642
The bracelets, in theory,

1232
01:33:25,725 --> 01:33:27,685
shut down our regeneration process.

1233
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:29,229
And once that happens,

1234
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:30,953
our bodies accumulate
extra cosmic energy.

1235
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:32,273
What for?

1236
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:35,235
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy,

1237
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:39,072
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1238
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,741
If I can find a way to connect us all,

1239
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:43,868
one of us could become
immensely powerful,

1240
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:46,746
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

1241
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:48,081
forming...

1242
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,002
a Uni-Mind.

1243
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:58,716
"Uni" meaning "one,"
"mind" meaning "mind."

1244
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:00,027
Oh, no,
we heard you the first time.

1245
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:01,812
- Terrible name.
- We'll brainstorm...

1246
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,012
"Brainstorm"!

1247
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,824
- That's a way better name!
- No, I invented it,

1248
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:05,950
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

1249
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:10,353
So suppose Druig can,
say... put Tiamut to sleep...

1250
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:11,646
Then what?

1251
01:34:11,813 --> 01:34:14,232
We find humans a new home
on another planet.

1252
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,067
Are we building a big ship, too?

1253
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:17,235
Take a pair of each animal?

1254
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:18,754
Well, you know
what's never saved the planet?

1255
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:19,779
Your sarcasm.

1256
01:34:19,946 --> 01:34:21,781
Space colonisation
could take decades.

1257
01:34:21,948 --> 01:34:23,388
It can happen quickly with our help.

1258
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:25,910
What if we end up
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1259
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:28,204
We could be responsible
for billions of lives

1260
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:29,831
not being created across the universe.

1261
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:31,291
Boss, am I right?

1262
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:34,711
Say something, lkaris.

1263
01:34:34,878 --> 01:34:36,546
You don't think
we should be doing this.

1264
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:45,680
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1265
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,017
Sersi should decide.

1266
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:53,438
Forget who Ajak chose.

1267
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:54,606
You're the strongest.

1268
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,774
You should be making this decision.

1269
01:34:57,859 --> 01:35:00,153
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

1270
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,696
Sprite.

1271
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,081
Okay, this is not...

1272
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:13,499
- lkaris.
- Don't run after him.

1273
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:15,668
Kingo, I... You guys.

1274
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:18,546
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1275
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,733
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

1276
01:35:20,757 --> 01:35:22,091
I'm okay, Kingo.

1277
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:24,111
If you think we should
do this, I trust you.

1278
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,804
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1279
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,308
What did you say?

1280
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:33,019
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1281
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:36,856
I'm not who you think I am.

1282
01:36:16,062 --> 01:36:17,689
How long do we have?

1283
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,691
Seven days.

1284
01:36:20,233 --> 01:36:21,526
Good.

1285
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,905
We completed our mission.

1286
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:29,492
Where is she?

1287
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:30,660
London.

1288
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:33,079
She has a good life there.

1289
01:36:33,246 --> 01:36:35,331
I'm sure she's missed you.

1290
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:36,624
If I'd gone back to her,

1291
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,835
I would only have told her the truth.

1292
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:42,297
She would've suffered

1293
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:44,966
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1294
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:46,301
Lkaris.

1295
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:49,012
We have to tell them the truth.

1296
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:50,596
What?

1297
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,515
- Why?
- Because together

1298
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,767
we might be able to stop the emergence.

1299
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:57,186
"Stop the emergence"?

1300
01:36:57,353 --> 01:36:58,354
Listen...

1301
01:36:58,521 --> 01:36:59,748
Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...

1302
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:00,773
Listen to me, lkaris.

1303
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:03,568
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

1304
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:06,362
And I have never doubted him.

1305
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:08,197
- Until now.
- Why now?

1306
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:10,533
Why now?

1307
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:17,582
Five years ago, Thanos erased

1308
01:37:17,707 --> 01:37:20,043
half of the population of the universe.

1309
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,338
Delayed the emergence.

1310
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:27,342
But the people of this planet

1311
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:30,762
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

1312
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:35,099
You know, after I let you all go,

1313
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:38,144
I travelled the world,
living among them.

1314
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:41,898
I have seen them fight and lie and kill,

1315
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:44,525
but I have also seen them

1316
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,111
laugh and love.

1317
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:51,282
I've seen them create and dream.

1318
01:37:54,202 --> 01:37:55,578
This planet

1319
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:57,955
and these people...

1320
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:01,084
have changed me.

1321
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:06,839
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1322
01:38:07,006 --> 01:38:08,633
Not this time.

1323
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:12,178
I trust you, Ajak.

1324
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:18,101
I'll follow you to the end,

1325
01:38:19,602 --> 01:38:21,104
as I always have.

1326
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,647
Thank you.

1327
01:38:24,273 --> 01:38:26,234
We have to bring
everyone back together.

1328
01:38:28,861 --> 01:38:31,197
There's something
I have to show you first.

1329
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:43,501
It's just up ahead.

1330
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,511
They must have been trapped
in the ice for centuries

1331
01:38:53,594 --> 01:38:54,929
and broke free last week

1332
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:56,597
when the glacier started to melt

1333
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,392
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1334
01:39:00,685 --> 01:39:03,020
They killed an entire company
of oil workers.

1335
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,481
I tracked them here.

1336
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:11,320
I suspected you might
have changed your mind.

1337
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,490
I can't let you betray Arishem.

1338
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,286
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

1339
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:19,537
When the others realise

1340
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,456
something is happening to the Earth,

1341
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:23,291
they'll come to you.

1342
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,334
When they find your body,

1343
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:26,878
they'll know the Deviants are back.

1344
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:29,964
It'll keep them busy
until the emergence.

1345
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:34,010
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

1346
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:36,804
Kept your secret for centuries,

1347
01:39:37,138 --> 01:39:39,891
lied to everyone I cared about,

1348
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:43,603
but never have I doubted my purpose

1349
01:39:43,686 --> 01:39:44,687
to serve the Celestials.

1350
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,315
Oh, lkaris.

1351
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:55,031
I've led you down the wrong path.

1352
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,241
It's the only path I know.

1353
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:52,958
Thought I'd find you here.

1354
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,878
I've thought about this place a lot.

1355
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:59,423
Amazing how things change over time.

1356
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:02,134
Maybe we're the ones
who've changed.

1357
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:06,931
I know you don't agree with our plan.

1358
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:09,409
I've always thought of the Celestials

1359
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:11,060
like the ocean.

1360
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:16,399
They give life and they take life away
without bias.

1361
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:17,942
If they were gone,

1362
01:43:18,025 --> 01:43:19,527
this universe would eventually end.

1363
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:21,112
What you're trying to do

1364
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:22,589
is free humanity from the natural order.

1365
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:24,615
It's not natural to allow all life

1366
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,409
on an entire planet to be destroyed.

1367
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:28,869
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

1368
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:30,996
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1369
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:32,790
It'll all end soon.

1370
01:43:32,957 --> 01:43:35,793
Except there is no end, is there?

1371
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:38,546
We'd carry on without our memories

1372
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:40,256
or free will

1373
01:43:40,423 --> 01:43:42,007
for eternity.

1374
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:49,098
You're afraid.

1375
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:52,143
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

1376
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:54,812
I only wish that when we do,

1377
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:58,649
I would be able to remember you.

1378
01:44:00,735 --> 01:44:03,195
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

1379
01:44:03,654 --> 01:44:06,532
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

1380
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:13,789
Ikaris.

1381
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:39,940
Sersi?

1382
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:46,113
It's started.

1383
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:50,493
Oh, no.
My God.

1384
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:52,077
What about the Uni-Mind?

1385
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:53,889
I haven't figured out a way

1386
01:44:53,913 --> 01:44:55,498
to connect us,
but I'm close.

1387
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:57,267
- I'm very, very close.
- How much longer?

1388
01:44:57,291 --> 01:44:59,293
I don't know, Sersi!

1389
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:03,839
Find the point of emergence.

1390
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:30,282
You always knew
the end was coming.

1391
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:33,077
It must be a relief.

1392
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:35,246
That Deviant is still tracking us.

1393
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:38,499
Revenge won't bring peace
for you, Thena.

1394
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:41,210
But killing it might.

1395
01:45:54,306 --> 01:45:55,724
Ikaris?

1396
01:45:57,142 --> 01:45:58,602
What are you doing?

1397
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:07,194
I wanted you to leave
this world in peace.

1398
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,948
Without knowing
about the emergence.

1399
01:46:11,323 --> 01:46:12,908
But I failed.

1400
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:18,455
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1401
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:27,006
I'm close to figuring it out.

1402
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:32,803
Boss, what are you doing?

1403
01:46:32,970 --> 01:46:34,530
I've let this go on
long enough.

1404
01:46:34,638 --> 01:46:36,557
Don't hurt him!

1405
01:46:37,683 --> 01:46:39,268
He lied to us.

1406
01:46:40,144 --> 01:46:41,896
He already knew about the emergence.

1407
01:46:42,605 --> 01:46:43,939
No, he didn't.

1408
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:46,817
Ajak told me everything
when we left Babylon.

1409
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:49,194
What?

1410
01:46:50,195 --> 01:46:52,531
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1411
01:46:52,698 --> 01:46:53,699
No.

1412
01:46:54,992 --> 01:46:57,661
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1413
01:46:57,995 --> 01:46:59,663
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,

1414
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:01,290
why did she choose me?

1415
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:07,504
What have you done?

1416
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,466
He killed her.

1417
01:47:13,218 --> 01:47:14,219
I had to.

1418
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:17,514
She loved you.

1419
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:21,977
- Did she?
- She loved you.

1420
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:26,690
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

1421
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:29,693
To know that one day all this would end?

1422
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:34,156
To keep on lying to you?

1423
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:37,826
If we gave humanity the choice,

1424
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:40,287
how many of them would be willing to die

1425
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:42,998
so that billions more could be born?

1426
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:45,542
We're not giving them a choice.

1427
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:48,921
Is this why you're willing to kill?

1428
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:53,342
You are so pathetic!

1429
01:47:53,759 --> 01:47:56,053
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1430
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:59,723
I exist for Arishem.

1431
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,141
As do you.

1432
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:02,643
It's who you are.

1433
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:05,938
I wouldn't change a single thing

1434
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:07,481
about who I am.

1435
01:48:07,648 --> 01:48:09,608
Born or made.

1436
01:48:09,775 --> 01:48:12,236
But I do not exist for Arishem,

1437
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:14,279
I exist for my family!

1438
01:48:14,446 --> 01:48:16,865
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1439
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:19,886
I found Tiamut.

1440
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,120
- No!
- Makkari!

1441
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:24,915
Get out of here!

1442
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,336
Kingo.

1443
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:39,847
You do not turn against your family.

1444
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:43,142
Gilgamesh died because of you.

1445
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,541
You won't succeed against me.

1446
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:50,107
And I will kill every one of you
if I have to.

1447
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:58,949
Wait.

1448
01:48:59,908 --> 01:49:00,951
I'm going with you.

1449
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:02,161
Sprite...

1450
01:49:03,954 --> 01:49:04,997
What is this?

1451
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,679
Why did Sprite go with lkaris?

1452
01:49:22,514 --> 01:49:24,349
Because she loves him.

1453
01:49:26,143 --> 01:49:28,604
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

1454
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:31,940
He really fooled us, didn't he?

1455
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:34,109
Karun, let's go.

1456
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:36,004
Wait, where the hell are you going?

1457
01:49:36,028 --> 01:49:37,946
I can't help you guys.

1458
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:40,574
I still think lkaris is right.

1459
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:43,243
So, that's it, huh?
Just gonna follow him?

1460
01:49:44,578 --> 01:49:46,580
I love the people of this planet.

1461
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:49,333
But if you stop this emergence,

1462
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,877
you are preventing so many
other worlds like this one

1463
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:53,629
from being created.

1464
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:56,173
I still have faith in Arishem.

1465
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:59,802
But I refuse to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

1466
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:05,715
We need you.

1467
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:08,352
Even with my help,
we're no match.

1468
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:10,771
It's lkaris.

1469
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:15,150
But...

1470
01:50:15,943 --> 01:50:17,820
I hope to see you on the next planet.

1471
01:50:22,116 --> 01:50:24,701
Thank you for all you've done...

1472
01:50:25,994 --> 01:50:28,038
...for humanity.

1473
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:31,792
It's been a great honour.

1474
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:36,338
I will miss you all.

1475
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:46,431
Look,

1476
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:50,144
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against lkaris,

1477
01:50:50,936 --> 01:50:52,813
we'll need to have a backup plan.

1478
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,740
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified,

1479
01:50:54,857 --> 01:50:56,457
are not enough to kill a Celestial,
so...

1480
01:50:56,567 --> 01:50:59,111
Well, Sersi did turn
a Deviant into a tree.

1481
01:51:00,112 --> 01:51:01,196
I'm sorry, what?

1482
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:02,948
You didn't wanna tell me that?

1483
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:05,385
You've never been able to do it before.

1484
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:06,827
I don't know how it happened, okay?

1485
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:09,413
And I'm pretty sure
I couldn't do it again.

1486
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:12,124
Well, now is the time
to try, don't you think?

1487
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:14,251
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1488
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:17,629
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep,
not to kill it.

1489
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:19,173
I can't kill a Celestial.

1490
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:20,966
Sersi. Sersi.

1491
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:22,509
We can't!

1492
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:29,600
We can't.

1493
01:51:29,766 --> 01:51:31,310
It's okay, Sersi.

1494
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:34,021
I got this.

1495
01:51:50,204 --> 01:51:51,830
There's no time for that.

1496
01:51:52,998 --> 01:51:55,709
I didn't see the lies
right in front of me.

1497
01:51:57,002 --> 01:51:59,880
I'm not even sure
why Ajak chose me to lead.

1498
01:52:01,423 --> 01:52:02,966
I asked Gilgamesh once

1499
01:52:03,467 --> 01:52:05,802
why he chose to protect me.

1500
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,638
He said,

1501
01:52:08,096 --> 01:52:11,433
"When you love something,
you protect it.

1502
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:16,772
"It is the most natural thing
in the world."

1503
01:52:19,441 --> 01:52:23,987
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1504
01:52:25,364 --> 01:52:30,786
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1505
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:34,581
Sersi.

1506
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:38,168
Get up.

1507
01:52:46,093 --> 01:52:48,553
Ajak chose you for a reason.

1508
01:52:53,517 --> 01:52:54,768
Sersi!

1509
01:52:55,227 --> 01:52:56,270
Sersi!

1510
01:52:56,436 --> 01:52:58,021
Oh, Sersi.
We need you!

1511
01:52:58,188 --> 01:52:59,731
I already gave that speech.

1512
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:00,941
What?

1513
01:53:01,108 --> 01:53:02,359
You did... What...

1514
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:05,529
Sersi, the sphere inside of you,

1515
01:53:05,696 --> 01:53:07,340
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1516
01:53:07,364 --> 01:53:10,492
Maybe I can repurpose it

1517
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,911
and create a connection between, uh,

1518
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:14,413
well, all of us.

1519
01:53:14,871 --> 01:53:17,165
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

1520
01:53:17,332 --> 01:53:19,001
- Great.
- Yeah.

1521
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:20,919
But, um...

1522
01:53:21,003 --> 01:53:23,839
I have to take it out of you.

1523
01:53:26,758 --> 01:53:27,968
Okay.

1524
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:30,554
Do it.

1525
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:33,307
Okay.

1526
01:53:41,315 --> 01:53:42,899
Don't kill her.

1527
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,276
Thena...

1528
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:46,928
Do it.

1529
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:01,501
Will it work?

1530
01:54:06,214 --> 01:54:07,632
It has to.

1531
01:54:59,476 --> 01:55:01,269
I'm glad you're here.

1532
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,025
Thank you, Sprite.

1533
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:23,708
Protect the emergence.

1534
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:25,627
You're really gonna kill them?

1535
01:55:33,468 --> 01:55:35,011
Where's Druig?

1536
01:55:35,554 --> 01:55:36,763
He's busy.

1537
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:39,015
Thena, play nice.

1538
01:55:42,811 --> 01:55:44,187
You've never had to fight me.

1539
01:55:44,354 --> 01:55:45,480
But I've always wanted to.

1540
01:55:53,905 --> 01:55:56,116
It's time to put a god to sleep.

1541
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:05,435
I should've done this
five centuries ago.

1542
01:57:52,691 --> 01:57:54,192
Druig's gone.

1543
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:56,486
It's over.

1544
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:04,804
Phastos.

1545
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:11,019
I have to try and stop this.

1546
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:12,896
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

1547
01:59:13,063 --> 01:59:15,023
- Keep lkaris busy.
- We've got you.

1548
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:16,191
Go.

1549
01:59:24,157 --> 01:59:25,784
Enough.

1550
01:59:56,106 --> 01:59:57,357
Thena, stop!

1551
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:30,849
Why are you helping lkaris?

1552
02:00:31,725 --> 02:00:33,405
We can't
let it absorb our powers.

1553
02:00:34,436 --> 02:00:35,562
Too late.

1554
02:00:37,188 --> 02:00:39,816
Thena, he's trying
to goad you. Don't...

1555
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,041
Makkari!

1556
02:01:05,884 --> 02:01:07,093
Where's Sersi?

1557
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:09,637
You always did
underestimate her.

1558
02:01:11,097 --> 02:01:12,348
Oh, no.

1559
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:14,809
Not so fast.

1560
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:20,607
Boss.

1561
02:01:24,778 --> 02:01:25,779
I don't know about you,

1562
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:27,655
but this is really satisfying, right?

1563
02:01:27,822 --> 02:01:30,158
Let me go, Phastos!
I can't let her do this!

1564
02:01:30,325 --> 02:01:31,618
I don't think so.

1565
02:01:32,035 --> 02:01:33,345
I've been wanting to clip your wings

1566
02:01:33,369 --> 02:01:35,497
for a long time, lkaris!

1567
02:01:48,802 --> 02:01:49,803
Thena.

1568
02:01:52,514 --> 02:01:55,433
Oh, you've changed.

1569
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,436
You're broken.

1570
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:00,730
Damaged.

1571
02:02:01,314 --> 02:02:03,149
Useless.

1572
02:02:05,401 --> 02:02:09,239
You can't protect any of them.

1573
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:24,712
Sersi.

1574
02:02:29,467 --> 02:02:32,387
You're not powerful enough
to do this.

1575
02:02:32,554 --> 02:02:34,472
And you won't.

1576
02:02:34,889 --> 02:02:36,641
You're not a killer.

1577
02:02:36,808 --> 02:02:38,393
Maybe I've changed.

1578
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:41,312
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

1579
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:44,107
Are you really willing to let
everyone on this planet die?

1580
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:54,701
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1581
02:03:07,171 --> 02:03:09,382
I've always envied you, Sersi.

1582
02:03:11,467 --> 02:03:13,511
'Cause you get to live
as one of them.

1583
02:03:14,053 --> 02:03:15,138
And I never could.

1584
02:03:16,389 --> 02:03:18,641
You know why I hated
living with humans?

1585
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:20,578
Because they reminded me of things

1586
02:03:20,602 --> 02:03:22,020
I didn't even know I wanted.

1587
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:23,938
Because of them,
now I wanna know

1588
02:03:24,022 --> 02:03:25,857
what it feels like to grow up.

1589
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:28,693
To fall in love.

1590
02:03:29,485 --> 02:03:31,112
To have a family.

1591
02:03:32,405 --> 02:03:36,075
And to know, in the end,
I've lived.

1592
02:03:43,249 --> 02:03:44,375
It's all over now.

1593
02:03:45,209 --> 02:03:47,545
We get to start over somewhere new.

1594
02:03:51,466 --> 02:03:53,092
Well, that was very moving.

1595
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:54,510
Druig.

1596
02:04:00,224 --> 02:04:01,768
I can't do this.

1597
02:04:05,396 --> 02:04:07,273
This is your fight now.

1598
02:04:51,818 --> 02:04:53,027
Thena.

1599
02:04:54,404 --> 02:04:55,655
It's me.

1600
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:57,407
Gilgamesh.

1601
02:04:58,825 --> 02:04:59,867
Look at me.

1602
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:02,203
Gilgamesh?

1603
02:05:02,370 --> 02:05:03,913
Stay here.

1604
02:05:06,624 --> 02:05:07,875
Say it.

1605
02:05:08,418 --> 02:05:10,086
Stay here.

1606
02:05:10,962 --> 02:05:12,672
You'll be okay.

1607
02:05:14,716 --> 02:05:16,551
Give me your hand.

1608
02:05:29,814 --> 02:05:31,024
Ah, it's a shame.

1609
02:05:33,067 --> 02:05:34,694
You and I,

1610
02:05:35,278 --> 02:05:37,196
we're just tools of a god.

1611
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:41,784
Built to kill.

1612
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:45,872
Thena.

1613
02:05:49,333 --> 02:05:50,710
Remember.

1614
02:06:21,157 --> 02:06:22,742
I remember.

1615
02:07:52,165 --> 02:07:53,624
Come on, Sersi.

1616
02:07:54,667 --> 02:07:55,751
Come on.

1617
02:10:05,006 --> 02:10:06,757
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1618
02:12:35,739 --> 02:12:37,283
I'm sorry.

1619
02:12:38,993 --> 02:12:40,453
I know.

1620
02:13:56,153 --> 02:13:57,196
How?

1621
02:13:57,655 --> 02:13:59,031
How did you do it?

1622
02:14:00,157 --> 02:14:03,410
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

1623
02:14:03,827 --> 02:14:06,205
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

1624
02:14:06,372 --> 02:14:07,706
I always wondered how we survived

1625
02:14:07,873 --> 02:14:10,543
the destruction of other planets
that we were on.

1626
02:14:10,918 --> 02:14:13,420
By being connected to
the Celestial as it emerged.

1627
02:14:26,058 --> 02:14:28,936
We became one...

1628
02:14:31,105 --> 02:14:33,857
...even lkaris and Sprite

1629
02:14:34,733 --> 02:14:40,072
all because of Tiamut.

1630
02:15:17,067 --> 02:15:18,277
Is he gone?

1631
02:15:27,953 --> 02:15:29,204
Sprite.

1632
02:15:31,707 --> 02:15:34,293
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

1633
02:15:35,377 --> 02:15:37,546
I think I can make you human.

1634
02:15:38,922 --> 02:15:41,842
All the things you said you wanted,
you can have them.

1635
02:15:42,009 --> 02:15:44,845
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one clay.

1636
02:15:45,012 --> 02:15:46,055
Are you ready for that?

1637
02:15:48,474 --> 02:15:49,892
I am.

1638
02:16:27,638 --> 02:16:28,782
<i>The sudden appearance</i>

1639
02:16:28,806 --> 02:16:30,974
<i>of an enormous stone figure
in the Indian Ocean</i>

1640
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:34,395
<i>has left more questions
than answers for authorities.</i>

1641
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:36,647
<i>US and Australian naval ships</i>

1642
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:38,273
<i>are maintaining defensive positions,</i>

1643
02:16:38,440 --> 02:16:39,441
<i>but at this...</i>

1644
02:16:39,608 --> 02:16:41,485
You guys did that?

1645
02:16:42,277 --> 02:16:44,571
I love you so much.

1646
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:53,247
Are you okay?

1647
02:16:54,164 --> 02:16:56,166
I get confused sometimes.

1648
02:16:56,375 --> 02:16:58,419
Yeah. Me, too.

1649
02:17:01,004 --> 02:17:03,298
So, Dad said
you're the goddess Athena.

1650
02:17:03,465 --> 02:17:05,551
"Thena." Drop the "A."

1651
02:17:06,719 --> 02:17:07,970
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1652
02:17:08,429 --> 02:17:10,264
What's your superpower?

1653
02:17:14,143 --> 02:17:16,395
Um, can you just...
Look... One second.

1654
02:17:17,146 --> 02:17:18,772
Okay. All right.

1655
02:17:19,314 --> 02:17:21,024
See, that thing is... Okay.

1656
02:17:21,191 --> 02:17:22,836
Almost gave you a shave
and a haircut, didn't she?

1657
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:24,319
Stand behind me, actually.

1658
02:17:24,528 --> 02:17:25,738
Um, you remember earmuffs?

1659
02:17:25,821 --> 02:17:28,407
Remember how we practised earmuffs?
Thank you so much.

1660
02:17:30,576 --> 02:17:32,202
You know that
your babysitting privileges

1661
02:17:32,286 --> 02:17:33,430
are completely revoked, right?

1662
02:17:33,454 --> 02:17:34,496
Like, it's done.

1663
02:17:34,997 --> 02:17:36,874
Thank you.
Violence... Hey.

1664
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,792
Violence is never the answer.

1665
02:17:38,876 --> 02:17:39,877
- Right, T?
- Hmm.

1666
02:17:40,043 --> 02:17:42,671
You gotta always use
your brain, hmm?

1667
02:17:42,838 --> 02:17:44,548
Like you did fighting on the beach?

1668
02:17:44,715 --> 02:17:45,966
Your dad

1669
02:17:46,133 --> 02:17:47,676
spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy

1670
02:17:47,801 --> 02:17:49,011
and he had no choice but to

1671
02:17:49,094 --> 02:17:50,255
listen to me,
so no violence.

1672
02:17:50,304 --> 02:17:51,704
The kid is ten...

1673
02:17:52,139 --> 02:17:53,599
...not stupid!

1674
02:17:54,224 --> 02:17:55,869
When are you guys leaving?
When is that happening?

1675
02:17:55,893 --> 02:17:57,770
That's happening soon, right?

1676
02:17:57,936 --> 02:17:59,205
Ah, yes, there's Druig.

1677
02:17:59,229 --> 02:18:00,830
- Don't go anywhere near him.
- Oh!

1678
02:18:01,315 --> 02:18:02,441
Yeah!

1679
02:18:04,860 --> 02:18:06,337
Okay, that's far enough, Jack.

1680
02:18:06,361 --> 02:18:08,697
Wow, Dad,
the <i>Domo's</i> so cool.

1681
02:18:08,864 --> 02:18:10,633
Your dad fixed that
with his bare hands.

1682
02:18:10,657 --> 02:18:12,242
Can we go to space, too, one day?

1683
02:18:12,409 --> 02:18:14,912
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

1684
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:17,206
Hey, Phastos.

1685
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:19,416
Take care.

1686
02:18:19,792 --> 02:18:21,376
This world is lucky to have you.

1687
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:23,837
Thank you.

1688
02:18:24,004 --> 02:18:25,672
I know you're not a hugger, so...

1689
02:18:28,842 --> 02:18:31,386
Okay.

1690
02:18:32,846 --> 02:18:36,934
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there,

1691
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:40,103
that they'll accept the truth
the way we did?

1692
02:18:42,231 --> 02:18:45,984
...because the truth will set them free.

1693
02:18:58,038 --> 02:18:59,748
Told you that thing
was addictive.

1694
02:19:00,916 --> 02:19:01,959
Please visit?

1695
02:19:02,584 --> 02:19:03,794
I'll try.

1696
02:19:04,378 --> 02:19:05,712
When I get time off from school.

1697
02:19:05,879 --> 02:19:07,357
Oh, wow. Listen,
it's gonna be good for you

1698
02:19:07,381 --> 02:19:08,549
to be in a human environment.

1699
02:19:08,715 --> 02:19:10,509
You'll pick up some social skills.

1700
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:12,572
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

1701
02:19:13,762 --> 02:19:15,764
That explains so much.

1702
02:19:25,482 --> 02:19:27,025
Gonna miss you.

1703
02:19:27,568 --> 02:19:28,777
Me, too.

1704
02:19:32,447 --> 02:19:33,574
Madam.

1705
02:19:34,032 --> 02:19:35,325
Thanks, Karun.

1706
02:19:35,909 --> 02:19:38,370
Sometimes I wonder
if we did the right thing.

1707
02:19:39,997 --> 02:19:41,081
Killing Tiamut.

1708
02:19:41,248 --> 02:19:43,000
It's too late for that.

1709
02:19:43,208 --> 02:19:45,168
But you followed your heart.

1710
02:19:45,335 --> 02:19:46,795
We all did.

1711
02:19:49,006 --> 02:19:50,007
Even lkaris.

1712
02:19:57,556 --> 02:19:59,516
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

1713
02:20:00,684 --> 02:20:02,811
He's a lot cuter in person.

1714
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:06,315
So, after all that,

1715
02:20:06,398 --> 02:20:08,442
you still can't change me
into a giraffe?

1716
02:20:09,109 --> 02:20:12,779
Well, I could next time
I'm connected to a Celestial

1717
02:20:12,946 --> 02:20:15,157
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

1718
02:20:15,324 --> 02:20:18,118
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

1719
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:23,498
What'll you do now?

1720
02:20:23,665 --> 02:20:24,958
Not sure.

1721
02:20:25,125 --> 02:20:27,127
This planet's my home, but...

1722
02:20:28,879 --> 02:20:31,590
I can't pretend to be human any more.

1723
02:20:38,138 --> 02:20:39,723
I love you, Sersi.

1724
02:20:41,266 --> 02:20:42,351
I don't care what you are.

1725
02:20:56,156 --> 02:20:58,784
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

1726
02:20:58,951 --> 02:21:01,954
I have no more secrets, I promise.

1727
02:21:02,204 --> 02:21:03,705
Actually,

1728
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:06,166
I have one I want to tell you.

1729
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:10,212
What is it?

1730
02:21:10,754 --> 02:21:13,256
It turns out my family history is...

1731
02:21:14,174 --> 02:21:15,759
complicated.

1732
02:21:19,137 --> 02:21:20,514
Sersi?

1733
02:21:21,306 --> 02:21:22,808
Sersi, what's wrong?

1734
02:21:24,267 --> 02:21:25,602
Sersi?

1735
02:21:49,459 --> 02:21:50,836
Sersi?

1736
02:21:51,712 --> 02:21:52,963
Sersi?

1737
02:21:53,839 --> 02:21:56,008
Sersi!

1738
02:22:10,772 --> 02:22:14,151
You have chosen
to sacrifice a Celestial

1739
02:22:14,526 --> 02:22:16,945
for the people of this planet.

1740
02:22:18,238 --> 02:22:20,032
I will spare them,

1741
02:22:20,198 --> 02:22:24,911
but your memories will show
if they are worthy to live.

1742
02:22:26,413 --> 02:22:30,625
And I will return for judgement.

1743
02:22:45,974 --> 02:22:48,018
You all right, Ted?

1744
02:22:49,728 --> 02:22:51,605
Did you see that?
